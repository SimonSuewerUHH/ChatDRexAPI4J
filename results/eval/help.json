  "question" : "How does Diamond work?",
  "answer" : "### How the **Diamond** algorithm works – in plain language\n\nThink of a biological network as a huge map where every gene or protein is a town and the connections between them are roads.  \nIf you start with a few “seed” towns (genes you already know are important), Diamond is a **step‑by‑step GPS** that finds the most cohesive neighborhood around those towns.\n\n#### 1. Start with your seeds  \n- You give Diamond a list of genes (e.g., *TP53, BRCA1*).  \n- The algorithm begins with those nodes as the seed community.\n\n#### 2. Grow the community one node at a time  \n- In each round, Diamond looks at every gene **not yet in the community**.  \n- For each candidate, it counts how many roads it shares with the **whole current community** (not just the original seeds).  \n\n#### 3. Pick the strongest link  \n- The candidate that has the *most statistically significant* number of connections to the current community is chosen.  \n- “Statistically significant” means it’s unlikely that the many connections happened by chance – the algorithm uses a p‑value or similar test.\n\n#### 4. Add and repeat  \n- That candidate is added to the community.  \n- The community has now grown, so the algorithm repeats the process:  \n  - Re‑evaluate all remaining genes against the *expanded* community.  \n  - Select the next best link.  \n  - Add it.  \n\n#### 5. Stop when you’re ready  \n- You can stop after a set number of steps (e.g., add 20 more genes) or when the community reaches a desired size.  \n- The result is an ordered list of genes that together form a tightly knit “disease module.”\n\n#### Why this matters  \n- **Linker proteins:** Because Diamond looks at connectivity to the whole community, it finds proteins that bridge different parts of the module—potential key players in disease pathways.  \n- **Module coherence:** The final set is statistically enriched for being functionally related, making it a useful starting point for further experiments or drug target discovery.\n\nIn short, Diamond walks the network like a careful explorer, always picking the gene that best ties the growing community together, and it does this until the community reaches the size or scope you specify.",

  "question" : "What is Drug repurposing?",
  "answer" : "**Drug repurposing (sometimes called “drug repositioning”)** is the process of finding new uses for medicines that are already approved or in late‑stage development for other diseases.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Fast‑track to patients** – the safety profile of the drug is already known, so the development timeline can shrink from years to months.  \n- **Lower cost** – no need for expensive early‑phase trials for safety.  \n- **Higher success rate** – many clinical trials fail because of safety concerns; repurposed drugs have a better chance of progressing.\n\n---\n\n### How it usually works (in a nutshell)\n\n| Step | What happens | What tools/ideas are used |\n|------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Define a target problem** | Pick a disease or condition that needs better treatments. | Literature mining, clinical data |\n| **2. Find a “candidate” drug** | Look for an existing drug that might affect a biological pathway involved in that disease. | Computational network analysis, similarity searches, machine learning |\n| **3. Test the hypothesis** | Run in‑vitro (cell culture), in‑vivo (animal models), or early human studies to see if the drug actually helps. | Pre‑clinical assays, small clinical trials |\n| **4. Bring to market** | If results are promising, move into larger clinical trials or regulatory approval for the new indication. | Regulatory pathways, repurposing agreements |\n\n---\n\n### How ChatDREx helps\n- **Seed your known genes** for a disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s) and let the system find a module of related proteins.  \n- **Rank potential drugs** that target those proteins using TrustRank or other prioritization tools.  \n- **Validate** the module with enrichment analysis (GO/KEGG) to ensure it’s biologically relevant.  \n- **Retrieve literature** that already links the drug to the new disease, speeding up the evidence gathering.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nDrug repurposing turns an “old” pill into a “new” treatment by matching its mechanism of action to a different disease’s biology—saving time, money, and, most importantly, benefiting patients sooner.",

Clarify Your Goal  \n- **Ask yourself:**  \n  - *What biological question do I want to answer?* (e.g., find new drug targets, uncover disease pathways, identify biomarkers)  \n  - *What type of answer am I looking for?* (a small gene module, a ranked list of candidate drugs, a pathway overview)\n\n## 2. Prepare Your Seed Set  \n- **Collect the genes/proteins** you already know are relevant (e.g., disease genes, experimental hits).  \n- **Check spelling & identifiers** (HGNC symbols, Ensembl IDs) so the system can match them.\n\n## 3. Choose the Right Analysis Path  \n| Goal | Suggested ChatDREx Path |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Discover a disease module** | **Diamond** → find a tightly‑connected community around your seeds. |\n| **Rank potential targets across the whole network** | **TrustRank** → get a global relevance score for all nodes. |\n| **Validate functional relevance** | **Digest (enrichment)** → test your module or ranked list against GO/KEGG. |\n| **Find repurposing candidates** | Combine **TrustRank** with drug‑target mapping from the knowledge graph. |\n\n## 4. Run the Analysis (conceptually)  \n- **Load the network** (usually the default PPI map).  \n- **Input your seed list** and set any algorithm parameters (e.g., module size, damping factor).  \n- **Launch the chosen tool** (Diamond, TrustRank, etc.).  \n\n## 5. Interpret the Results  \n- **Module view**: see which genes were added and how they connect.  \n- **Ranking list**: check top candidates and their evidence.  \n- **Enrichment report**: look for over‑represented pathways or functions.  \n\n## 6. Take the Findings Forward  \n- **Prioritize candidates** for experimental validation or literature review.  \n- **Export results** (tables, network files) to share with collaborators.  \n- **Iterate**: tweak seeds or parameters based on what you learned.\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Next Step” Checklist  \n1. Write down one clear research question.  \n2. Assemble a short seed list of genes/proteins.  \n3. Pick Diamond if you want a module, or TrustRank if you want a global ranking.  \n4.

  "answer" : "## ChatDREx Basics – Your “Hello‑World” Walk‑through  \n\nBelow is a simple, step‑by‑step recipe that covers everything you need to get started, without any code or deep technical jargon. Think of it as a **road trip map** for your research question.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **State Your Destination**  \n- **What you want to find**: Write a single sentence that tells ChatDREx *why* you’re here.  \n  - *Example*: “Find new drug‑target genes for Parkinson’s disease that are involved in protein‑aggregation pathways.”  \n- Why it matters: The system uses this sentence to decide which tools to use and what knowledge to bring in.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Pick Your “Starting Cars” – Seed Genes/Proteins**  \n- **Seeds** are the genes/proteins you already know are important.  \n- Gather 5–10 **standard gene symbols** (e.g., *LRRK2, SNCA, MAPT*).  \n- Check for typos—ChatDREx won’t recognize “SNaC” but will with “SNCA.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Choose Your GPS (Algorithm)**  \n| Goal | GPS to Use | What it gives you |\n|------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Find a **tight, disease‑specific group** of genes | **Diamond** (Community Finder) | A small, highly interconnected “module” around your seeds. |\n| Rank **every gene** in the map by relevance | **TrustRank** (Prioritization Engine) | A global list of candidates, not limited to the module. |\n| Look for drug‑repurposing candidates | TrustRank → map to known drug targets | Candidate drugs linked to ranked genes. |\n\n*Tip*: Start with **Diamond** if you want a focused module, then try **TrustRank** for a broader view.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Load the Map (Biological Network)**  \n- ChatDREx automatically loads the latest protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network.  \n- It’s like opening a city map before you start driving.  \n- If you need a different species or a custom network, that can be set later.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Run the GPS**  \n- **Enter your seeds** into the input box.  \n- **Set a basic parameter** (e.g., “module size = 30” for Diamond).  \n- Hit **Start**.  \n- The system will traverse the network and return a list of genes.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Decipher the Route – Enrichment (Digest)**  \n- Take the gene list and run a **Digest** enrichment step.  \n- It asks: “Are these genes unusually involved in *immune response* or *protein folding*?”  \n- The answer is a set of biological themes (GO terms, KEGG pathways) with a significance score (p‑value / FDR).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Save & Share**  \n- **Download** the gene list, enrichment table, and a visual network snapshot.  \n- Use the files for experiments, presentations, or collaboration.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. **Fine‑Tune the Journey**  \n- If the module is too small or too large, adjust the module size in Diamond.  \n- If you want to see different angles, switch to TrustRank.  \n- Add or remove seeds and rerun to see how the map changes.\n\n---\n\n## Quick “Starter Checklist”\n\n1. **Goal**: Write a one‑sentence research question.  \n2. **Seeds**: Compile 5–10 gene symbols.  \n3. **Choose Tool**: Diamond (module) or TrustRank (ranking).  \n4. **Run** the selected algorithm.  \n5. **Enrich** the result with Digest.  \n6. **Export** the output.  \n7. **Iterate** as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\nThink of ChatDREx as a *smart co‑pilot* that navigates a massive biological map based on the landmarks (seeds) you give it.

Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for exploring how proteins talk to each other and what that means for disease, drugs, and biology.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Start with a Question or a Gene List**  \n- **Research Question**: “Find new drug targets for Alzheimer’s disease linked to tau aggregation.”  \n- **Seed Genes**: Your own list of known genes (e.g., *MAPT, PSEN1*).  \n\nChatDREx reads the question or list and builds a map of the relevant biology.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Explore the Protein‑Protein Interaction (PPI) Map**  \n- A huge, up‑to‑date network that connects almost every human protein to others that it physically or functionally interacts with.  \n- Think of it as a city map where each protein is a node and each interaction is a road.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Discover Hidden Communities (Modules)**  \n- **Diamond (DIAMOnD)**  \n  - Starts from your seeds and *grows* a tightly‑connected cluster.  \n  - Adds genes that are statistically most connected to the whole growing community, not just the original seeds.  \n  - Great for uncovering a disease‑specific module or “linker” proteins that might be key regulators.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Rank the Whole Network for Relevance**  \n- **TrustRank** (a PageRank‑style engine)  \n  - Spreads “trust” from your seeds across the entire map.  \n  - Produces a global ranking of all genes by how strongly they are connected to the seeds, taking into account multiple paths and distance.  \n  - Useful when you want a prioritized list of candidate genes, drugs, or pathways across the entire network.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Translate Genes into Biology**  \n- **Digest (Enrichment/Validation)**  \n  - Takes the gene set produced by Diamond or TrustRank.  \n  - Checks against curated knowledge bases (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Reactome, etc.).  \n  - Highlights over‑represented functions, biological processes, or pathways with statistical confidence (p‑values, FDR).  \n  - Turns a raw list of proteins into a story about the biology they are involved in.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Find Potential Drug Connections**  \n- By mapping the ranked or module genes onto the NeDRex knowledge graph, ChatDREx can identify existing drugs or drug targets that are connected to your genes of interest.  \n- Useful for drug‑repurposing or identifying new therapeutic avenues.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Export, Share, and Visualize**  \n- Download gene lists, enrichment tables, and network snapshots.  \n- Interactive visualizations let you explore the module or ranking directly in the browser.  \n- Share results with collaborators or embed them in presentations.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Iterate Quickly**  \n- Add or remove seeds, adjust module size or damping factor, and re‑run to see how results change.  \n- A fast feedback loop that keeps you moving from hypothesis to new ideas in minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line  \n- **Ask a question or give a gene list** →  \n- **Map it onto a massive protein network** →  \n- **Discover a focused module (Diamond) or rank the entire network (TrustRank)** →  \n- **Convert genes to enriched biology (Digest)** →  \n- **Spot drug links** →  \n- **Export/visualize**.\n\nThat’s the power of ChatDREx: it connects your genes to the rest of the human proteome, finds the most relevant groups or candidates, and tells you *what those proteins actually do*. No command‑line, no heavy computing, just biology in a few clicks.",

  "answer" : "## What’s Next After Your First Run?  \n\nBelow is a “road‑map” that shows the natural next steps you can take once you’ve seen your first module or ranking. Pick the ones that fit your project’s goals and keep iterating.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Refine the Seeds & Parameters**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Add or remove seed genes** | Sometimes a small tweak (e.g., adding `P53BP1`) will pull in a different module or reveal a new hub. | Edit the seed list in the Question/Seed box → click **Run** again. |\n| **Change module size (Diamond)** | A larger module may capture more downstream players; a smaller one may focus on the core. | Adjust the “Module size” slider → re‑run. |\n| **Adjust damping factor (TrustRank)** | A higher damping value (closer to 1) makes trust spread farther, potentially highlighting distant candidates. | Set the slider → re‑run. |\n| **Turn on “Show Pathways in Map”** | Gives you a visual cue of which pathway edges are most important. | Toggle the option in the toolbar. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Run the Alternative Algorithm**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Run TrustRank on the same seeds** | TrustRank gives you a global “relevance score” for every protein, not just those that sit in a tight cluster. | Switch the algorithm selector → set parameters → click **Run**. |\n| **Compare both results** | Look for genes that appear in both the module and the ranking – those are strong candidates. | Open both Results panels side‑by‑side. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Dive Deeper Into the Network**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Zoom into a sub‑cluster** | Often a sub‑cluster contains a signaling cascade you can follow experimentally. | Drag + scroll to focus on the sub‑graph → click nodes for details. |\n| **Use the “Filter by Degree”** | Highlight hubs (high‑degree nodes) that could be master regulators. | In the Results table, sort by “Degree” or use the filter drop‑down. |\n| **Export a sub‑network** | Useful for downstream modeling or for sharing a focused story. | Right‑click the map → “Export Sub‑network” (CSV or GraphML). |\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Functional Interpretation & Hypothesis Building**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Run additional enrichment (e.g., Reactome, MSigDB)** | Different databases capture different biological angles. | In the **Digest** panel, choose “Add Dataset” → pick Reactome → click **Digest** again. |\n| **Create a “Heatmap” of term‑gene overlap** | Visualizes which genes drive which terms, helping you spot “driver” pathways. | In the Enrichment panel, click **Show Heatmap** (if available). |\n| **Compare to known disease modules** | Validates your findings or reveals novel gaps. | Use the “Compare” button → upload a reference module (e.g., from DisGeNET) → view overlap. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Translate to Therapeutics**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Explore drug‑target links (TrustRank)** | Spot already‑approved drugs that hit your top genes—prime candidates for repurposing. | In the **Drug‑Target Explorer** panel → filter by “Approved” or “Clinical Stage.” |\n| **Use the Knowledge‑Graph layer** | Connect genes to biomarkers, pathways, and clinical trials in a single view. | Open the **KG Explorer** → search for your module genes → view linked drug trials. |\n| **Generate a repurposing list** | Create a candidate list for experimental validation or for a grant proposal. | Export the ranked genes + drug links → paste into a spreadsheet for follow‑up. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Add External Data Layers**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Upload a gene‑expression matrix** | Overlay differential expression to see which module members are actually up‑ or down‑regulated. | In the **Data Upload** panel → choose “Expression” → load your CSV. |\n| **Add post‑translational modifications (PTMs)** | PTMs often govern interaction strength; integrating them can refine the network. | Upload a PTM file → see PTM‑filtered edges on the map. |\n| **Overlay a copy‑number variation (CNV) map** | Identify genes that are amplified or deleted in your disease context. | Use the **Overlay** button → choose CNV dataset. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Validate & Extend**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Cross‑check with public disease modules** | Confirms that your module matches known biology or uncovers novel players. | Search “Known modules” → compare overlaps. |\n| **Run a pathway‑based screen (e.g., KEGG)** | Helps design targeted experiments (e.g., pathway inhibition assays). | In **Digest**, click a pathway → export the gene‑pathway table. |\n| **Generate a literature synopsis** | Provides the narrative for a manuscript or grant. | Use the “Recent Papers” panel → filter by your module genes. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Collaboration & Documentation**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Create a shared workspace** | Lets teammates view the map, tweak seeds, and add comments. | Click **Share** → choose “Add to Workspace” (or similar). |\n| **Export a PDF report** | Quick way to capture the map, tables, and enrichment for a meeting or a slide deck. | In the top toolbar → “Export → PDF.” |\n| **Annotate the map** | Keep track of hypotheses or caveats. | Use the annotation tool (pencil icon) → type notes on nodes. |\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Plan for Downstream Experiments**\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How |\n|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Select top candidates for CRISPR or siRNA screens** | Test whether knocking them down changes your phenotype. | Take the top 10–15 genes → prepare a knockout list. |\n| **Order antibodies or kits** | Validate protein‑protein interactions in vitro. | Use the gene links to find reagents. |\n| **Submit to a pre‑print or journal** | Present your module and enrichment as a hypothesis generator. | Export the map and tables → include them in the manuscript. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Next‑Step Checklist”\n\n1. **Seed‑tweaking** → 2. **Parameter tuning** → 3. **TrustRank comparison** → 4. **Enrichment deep‑dive** → 5. **Drug repurposing** → 6. **Overlay external data** → 7. **Validate experimentally** → 8. **Collaborate & publish**.  \n\nFeel free to loop back to earlier steps as you learn more about the biology or as new data arrives. The interface is designed for rapid iteration—every change gives you a fresh story to test. Happy exploring!",

  "answer" : "## How to Turn ChatDREx Results Into Biological Insight  \n\nBelow is a practical guide that walks you from the raw tables and graphs to the key questions you should ask about the output you see.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Look at the **Module or Ranking Order**\n\n| What you’ll see | What it means | What to ask yourself |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| **Gene list ordered by “Addition Order” (Diamond)** | Genes that entered the module early are typically core drivers; late additions are more peripheral. | “Are the first 3‑5 genes the known drivers of this pathway?” |\n| **Gene ranking (TrustRank)** | Every node gets a *relevance score*; higher rank = more central to your seed set. | “Does a high‑rank gene also have high expression or known disease association?” |\n\n**Tip:** Overlay the two views. Genes that appear in both the tight module and the global ranking are especially compelling.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Examine **Node Properties** in the Map\n\n| Property | Interpretation | Practical check |\n|----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Degree (how many edges)** | Hubs might be master regulators or common binding partners. | “Is this node a known transcription factor?” |\n| **Betweenness centrality** | Nodes that sit on many shortest paths can be critical conduits. | “Does this gene lie in a signaling cascade?” |\n| **Score (TrustRank)** | Reflects how much influence the gene has in the network with respect to your seeds. | “Is this a drug target already?” |\n| **Order (Diamond)** | Shows the chronological expansion of the module. | “Did the module grow by adding a signaling chain?” |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Read the **Enrichment (Digest) Panel**\n\n| Enriched Category | What It Tells You | Next Question |\n|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Gene Ontology (Biological Process)** | Reveals common cellular functions of the module. | “Which process is most statistically significant?” |\n| **Reactome / KEGG Pathways** | Maps genes onto known pathways. | “Do all module genes belong to one pathway, or are there multiple?” |\n| **p‑value / q‑value** | Indicates statistical confidence. | “Is the p‑value < 0.05 after multiple‑testing correction?” |\n| **Gene‑term overlap** | Shows which genes drive each term. | “Which genes are the major contributors to the top GO term?” |\n\n**Interpretation rule:** A high‑score term with a handful of strong‑ranking genes is a more specific hypothesis than a broad, low‑score term.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Assess **Drug‑Target Connections**\n\n| Drug link info | Interpretation | Follow‑up |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Drug name + approval status** | Shows whether you can repurpose an existing drug. | “Can I test this drug in my cell line?” |\n| **Target overlap count** | If many module genes are hit by one drug, the drug might have pleiotropic effects. | “Is that desirable (synergistic) or risky (off‑target)?” |\n| **Clinical phase** | Guides feasibility of moving to human studies. | “Is the drug in phase III trials?” |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Look for **Heterogeneity & Sub‑modules**\n\n| Observation | What to consider | Insight |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| A small cluster of highly connected nodes within the module | Likely a core signaling hub. | These may be the “core” drivers of the phenotype. |\n| A few low‑degree nodes linking to many peripheral nodes | These could be “bridges” that connect modules. | Potential therapeutic points to cut network flow. |\n| Nodes that appear only in TrustRank but not in Diamond | They may be distant but still relevant. | Could be candidates for drug repurposing. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Validate Against **External Evidence**\n\n| Source | What to cross‑check | Insight gained |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Public disease modules (e.g., DisGeNET)** | Overlap of your module with known disease genes. | Confirms biological relevance or highlights novel genes. |\n| **Expression data** | Are module genes up‑ or down‑regulated in your condition? | Prioritizes genes that are active in the disease state. |\n| **Literature (Semantic Scholar panel)** | Recent papers citing your module genes. | Provides mechanistic context and potential pitfalls. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Think in Terms of **Causality vs Correlation**\n\n- **High‑degree hubs** may simply be “connectors” rather than *drivers*.\n- **Low‑degree, highly ranked genes** can be the real culprits.\n- **Enrichment terms** that have *few* but *strong* contributors are more likely to be causal.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Draft a Narrative\n\n1. **Identify the Core**: List the top 3‑5 genes that are central in both module and ranking.  \n2. **Map to a Pathway**: Pick one enriched pathway that involves those core genes.  \n3. **State the Hypothesis**: “Knockdown of X (core gene) will disrupt pathway Y, leading to phenotypic change Z.”  \n4. **Provide Supporting Data**: Show the node score, the enrichment p‑value, and any drug‑target links.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Interpretation Checklist\n\n1. **Check node centrality** – hubs vs periphery.  \n2. **See order of addition** – core vs peripheral.  \n3. **Cross‑validate with enrichment** – terms, pathways, p‑values.  \n4. **Look for drug links** – therapeutic relevance.  \n5. **Overlay external data** – expression, CNV.  \n6. **Ask if the results make biological sense** – literature, known disease biology.  \n7. **Prioritize** – rank by a composite of score, centrality, and druggability.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nInterpretation is a *story‑telling* exercise. Use the module to tell the core narrative, enrich the map with functional themes, and then connect that story to drugs or experiments. The better you can articulate *why* a gene appears in the module or ranking, the more convincing your hypothesis will be for downstream work.",

  "question" : "What are the possibilities with ChatDREx?",
  "answer" : "## What You Can Do With ChatDREx  \nChatDREx is a one‑stop “GPS for biology” that lets you explore a huge protein‑protein map, find hidden communities, rank potential targets, and see what the data actually mean—all without writing a single line of code. Below is a quick‑look guide to the main possibilities, grouped by the type of insight you’re after.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Discover Hidden Disease Modules**  \n*Think of it as a detective that starts at your known suspects and expands outward.*\n\n| What it does | When you’d use it | Example |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | You want a small, tightly‑connected group of proteins that surround your seed genes. | Finding a “TP53‑centered” module that might explain why TP53 mutations drive a particular cancer. |\n| **Module visualisation** | Inspect the exact layout, see which proteins are in the core, and how they talk to each other. | Spotting a signaling chain that links TP53 to downstream DNA‑repair proteins. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Rank Every Protein by Relevance**  \n*Like a popularity contest, but for biological relevance to your seeds.*\n\n| What it does | When you’d use it | Example |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------|\n| **TrustRank (TrustRank)** | You want a global view of “who matters most” to your seed set, even if they’re not in a tight cluster. | Identifying distant but high‑impact proteins that could be druggable. |\n| **Global score visualisation** | You can quickly see which proteins would be best first‑in‑class targets. | A list of top‑ranked kinases that connect to a disease seed. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Translate to Therapeutic Leads**  \n*Turn biology into medicine in a single click.*\n\n| What it does | When you’d use it | Example |\n|--------------|------------------|---------|\n| **Drug‑Target Explorer** | You want to know if any approved drugs hit your top genes. | Repurposing the drug **PARP‑inhibitor** for TP53‑driven tumors. |\n| **Knowledge‑Graph (KG) overlay** | You need to see drugs, biomarkers, and clinical trials all in the same view. | Linking a TP53‑module to a clinical trial for a new immunotherapy. |\n| **Drug‑Repurposing lists** | You’re looking for “off‑the‑shelf” options that can be fast‑tracked into experiments. | Generating a shortlist of FDA‑approved drugs that hit your module’s hub genes. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Add Context From External Data Layers**  \n*Your map becomes richer when you put expression, mutations, or PTMs on top.*\n\n| Layer you can add | What you learn | How it helps |\n|-------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Gene‑expression heatmap** | See if the proteins you found are actually turned on or off in your disease sample. | Validates the module as biologically active. |\n| **Copy‑number variation (CNV)** | Detect amplified or deleted genes in a cancer. | Spot a hub gene that’s often amplified in breast cancer. |\n| **Post‑translational modifications (PTMs)** | Filter edges that only exist when a protein is phosphorylated, for example. | Refine the network to the most “active” interactions. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Perform Functional Interpretation (Digest)**  \n*It’s like summarising a research paper in one tidy table.*\n\n| What you’ll get | What it tells you | Why it matters |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Enriched GO terms / Reactome / KEGG pathways** | Common biological functions of your module. | Identifies the signalling pathway most likely driving the phenotype. |\n| **Statistical scores (p‑/q‑values)** | Confidence that the enrichment isn’t random. | Helps decide whether a term is worth following up. |\n| **Gene‑term overlap** | Which genes are the “drivers” of each function. | Focuses experimental validation on the most influential proteins. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Integrate with the Knowledge‑Graph (KG) Layer**  \n*Move from a flat list of proteins to a web of diseases, biomarkers, and clinical evidence.*\n\n| What it adds | Why it’s useful | Example |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------|\n| **Disease‑gene associations** | Compare your module to curated disease modules. | Shows whether your TP53 module overlaps with known breast‑cancer genes. |\n| **Biomarker links** | Connect proteins to measurable clinical markers. | Identify a module gene that is a serum biomarker. |\n| **Trial & clinical data** | See if a module target has already been tested in patients. | Quick check on whether a drug that hits a module hub is in phase II trials. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Plan and Design Experiments**  \n*ChatDREx can help you pick the most promising genes or drugs to test next.*\n\n| What you can do | How it assists | Typical output |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Generate CRISPR/siRNA candidate lists** | Use the top‑ranked genes as knock‑down targets. | A 10‑gene list for a pooled‑screen. |\n| **Order antibodies / kits** | Link genes to available reagents. | Quickly find commercial antibodies for module proteins. |\n| **Create a pre‑print or slide deck** | Export map images, tables, and enrichment summaries. | One‑click PDF that’s ready for a meeting. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Collaborate and Share**  \n*Your workspace is like a shared whiteboard that teammates can annotate in real time.*\n\n| Feature | Benefit | How to use |\n|---------|--------|-----------|\n| **Shared workspace** | Everyone sees the same map, can tweak seeds, add comments. | Click the “Share” icon → add collaborators. |\n| **Annotation tool** | Leave notes on why you think a gene matters. | Click the pencil icon on a node → type your hypothesis. |\n| **Export options** | PDF, PNG, CSV, or a link that preserves the exact state. | Use the toolbar → “Export” → choose format. |\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Extend With Your Own Data**  \n*Blend your experimental results directly onto the map.*\n\n| Data type you can upload | How it enriches the story | Quick example |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| **RNA‑seq / microarray** | See if module genes are actually expressed in your samples. | Overlay a heatmap of TP53‑module genes in tumor vs normal tissue. |\n| **Copy‑number / mutation data** | Highlight genes that are amplified or deleted. | A CNV overlay shows BRCA2 as amplified in a patient cohort. |\n| **PTM datasets** | Filter interactions that only happen after phosphorylation. | PTM‑filtered map reveals a kinase‑driven sub‑module. |\n\n---\n\n## In a Nutshell  \nWith ChatDREx you can:\n\n1. **Start** from a handful of genes (or a question).  \n2. **Discover** the small, disease‑relevant protein community around those genes.  \n3. **Rank** every protein by how “important” it is to your seeds.  \n4. **Translate** the numbers into biology (enrichment, pathways, drugs).  \n5. **Layer** additional data (expression, CNV, PTMs).

  "question" : "What actions are available (planner actions)?",
  "answer" : "## Planner Actions – The “What’s In the Toolbox”\n\nThese are the building blocks that the ChatDREx planner can call to get you the results you asked for. Think of each one as a *tool in a Swiss‑army kit*—you pick the right tool for the job, and the planner hands it out. Below is a plain‑English rundown of every action and when you might see it used.\n\n| Action | What It Does (in everyday terms) | Typical Use‑Case |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n| **FETCH_NETWORK** | “Get the map ready.” The planner loads or refreshes the protein‑interaction network that ChatDREx will work on. | Anytime you start a new question or the network is out of date. |\n| **UPDATE_NETWORK** | “Add or tweak the map.” You can change which seed genes you want to start from, tweak filters (e.g., only high‑confidence edges), or alter any other settings on the current network. | When you want to explore a different set of seeds or adjust the scope of the analysis. |\n| **FETCH_RESEARCH** | “Pull in the latest papers.” The planner pulls in abstracts, key terms, or recent findings that relate to your goal or seeds. | Want context or background literature to help interpret results. |\n| **FETCH_CHATDREX** | “Set the stage for the core algorithms.” It brings the necessary context so the main tools (DIAMOnD or TrustRank) can run. | Before launching a module expansion or ranking step. |\n| **FETCH_KG** | “Load the knowledge‑graph side‑data.” This brings in disease‑gene links, drug associations, biomarkers, etc., from the NeDRex knowledge‑graph. | If you want to overlay drug‑target or disease‑association information. |\n| **FETCH_BIO_INFO** | “Clarify any vague biology.” The planner looks up synonyms, related terms, or clarifies ambiguous user inputs. | When the user’s question is a bit unclear or uses uncommon terminology. |\n| **CALL_CHATDREX_TOOL** | “Run the core analysis.” This actually executes DIAMOnD (module expansion) or TrustRank (global ranking) on the current network. | The heart of any module or ranking request. |\n| **CALL_NEDREX_TOOL** | “Run something directly on the knowledge‑graph.” This is for algorithms that work on the NeDRex graph rather than the PPI map. | For specialized graph‑based queries that need the full KG. |\n| **CALL_DIGEST_TOOL** | “Do the ‘So What?’ step.” It runs functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, etc.) on a list or sub‑network. | After you have a gene set and want to know what functions or pathways are over‑represented. |\n| **FINALIZE** | “Wrap it up.” The planner formats the findings into a clean, human‑readable summary (tables, bullet points, etc.) that you can copy or share. | When you’re ready to present the results to a colleague or write them into a report. |\n\n---\n\n### How They Fit Together\n\n1. **Start** → *FETCH_NETWORK* (or *FETCH_KG* if you’re using the KG)  \n2. **Prepare** → *UPDATE_NETWORK* (set seeds, filters)  \n3. **Add Context** → *FETCH_RESEARCH*, *FETCH_BIO_INFO*  \n4. **Run Core Analysis** → *CALL_CHATDREX_TOOL* (DIAMOnD or TrustRank)  \n5. **Validate/Interpret** → *CALL_DIGEST_TOOL*  \n6. **Add Drug or Disease Links** → *FETCH_KG* or *CALL_NEDREX_TOOL* (optional)  \n7. **Finish** → *FINALIZE* (human‑readable report)\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nEvery action is a *request* the planner makes to the underlying system. You, as the user, simply tell it what you want (e.g., “find a module around TP53 and rank the network”), and the planner builds a pipeline of these actions to deliver the final answer.

  "question" : "What are my next steps right now?",
  "answer" : "## Your Next Steps with ChatDREx – Quick‑Start Checklist  \n\nBelow are the concrete actions you can take right now to get useful insights from ChatDREx. Pick whichever fits your immediate goal, or try a couple of them for a fuller picture.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Start with a Clear Question  \n* **Think of a single, focused request** – e.g.  \n  - “Find genes that cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer.”  \n  - “Rank proteins related to Alzheimer’s.”  \n  - “What pathways are enriched in my 50‑gene list?”  \n\nType that sentence into the chat box and hit **Enter**.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Provide Seed Genes (if needed)  \n* If your question mentions a specific gene, ChatDREx will usually auto‑detect it.  \n* Otherwise, paste a short list (semicolon‑ or comma‑separated).  \n  - `TP53; BRCA1; EGFR`  \n\n---\n\n### 2.  Pick an Analysis (Optional)  \n* **If you already know what you want**:  \n  - **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** – builds a tight disease module.  \n  - **TrustRank** – scores the *entire* interactome for relevance.  \n  - **Digest** – gives GO/KEGG enrichment.  \n\n  Type the tool name into the question or click the dropdown that appears.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Set Basic Parameters (Optional)  \n* **Module size** – e.g. “Top 20 proteins.”  \n* **Damping factor** – if you’re using TrustRank.  \n* **Number of genes to return** – for rankings or enrichment.  \n\nThese show up as sliders/number boxes after you choose the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Upload Your Own Data (If Available)  \n* **RNA‑seq, CNV, mutation, PTM files** (CSV/TSV/Excel).  \n* Click the **Upload** button that appears after your question or in the sidebar.  \n* This lets ChatDREx color‑code the network to match your samples.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Review the Suggested Planner Actions  \n* ChatDREx will automatically ask follow‑ups if it needs more details (e.g., “Confirm TP53 as the seed?”).  \n* Simply **confirm or adjust** as prompted.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Run the Analysis  \n* After confirming your seeds and parameters, ChatDREx will kick off the appropriate algorithms.  \n* You’ll see a **live map** appear almost immediately, along with tables and a short summary.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Explore & Refine  \n* **Click on nodes** to view drug links, literature, and disease associations.  \n* **Use the sidebar**:  \n  - **Enrichment** panel → GO/KEGG statistics.  \n  - **Drug‑Target** tab → list of drugs and clinical trials.  \n  - **More Analyses** → try a second tool (e.g., run TrustRank after DIAMOnD).\n\n---\n\n### 8.  Save & Share  \n* **Download**: CSV for tables, PNG/PDF for maps, or a full PDF report.  \n* **Copy the shareable link** that appears in the top bar to give colleagues a live view.\n\n---\n\n### Quick One‑Turn Example  \n```\nChatDREx: \"Find genes that cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer.\"\nSeeds: TP53 (auto‑suggested) – confirm\nAnalysis: DIAMOnD (default)\nResult: 20‑gene module map + enrichment summary + drug overlay\nDownload: CSV of gene list + PDF of summary\n```\n\n---\n\n**Ready to go?**  \n1. Write your question in the chat.  \n2. Confirm any seed genes it suggests.  \n3. (Optional) Upload a file if you have one.  \n4. Hit **Enter** – the rest is automatic.\n\nThat’s it! Once you see the map and tables, you can keep exploring, tweak filters, or pick another analysis to deepen the story. Happy exploring!",

  "question" : "Can you walk me through an example (no execution)?",
  "answer" : "## Walk‑through (No‑Execution Example)\n\nLet’s pretend you’re a researcher who wants to **discover new proteins that might work together with the tumor suppressor TP53 in breast cancer**.  \nBelow is the *conversation* you would have with ChatDREx, plus the behind‑the‑scenes steps it would trigger—all explained in plain language.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  State the Question  \n> **You:** “What proteins cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer?”\n\nChatDRex reads the sentence, recognises “TP53” as the key gene, and understands that you’re looking for a *disease module* (i.e., a small, tightly‑connected community around TP53).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Provide/Confirm Seed Genes  \n| What ChatDREx Does | Why It Matters |\n|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Suggests** “TP53” as the seed. | The system auto‑detects any gene symbol you mention. |\n| **Asks you to confirm** it’s the right seed. | Keeps you in control of what starts the search. |\n\n> **You’d just click “Yes”** (or “Confirm”) to keep TP53 as the seed.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Pick the Analysis Type  \n| Choice | Tool | What It Would Do |\n|--------|------|------------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | *Module‑expansion* | Starts from TP53, then pulls in the most densely‑connected proteins that are likely part of the same functional unit. |\n| **TrustRank** | *Global ranking* | Would score every protein in the whole interactome for how strongly it’s linked to TP53, producing a list of “most relevant” proteins. |\n| **Digest (enrichment)** | *Functional interpretation* | Would test whether the final gene set is over‑represented in known biological terms (GO, KEGG, etc.). |\n\n> For this example, we’ll imagine you choose **DIAMOnD** (the “Diamond” tool) because you’re after a compact “TP53 disease module”.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Set Simple Parameters (Optional)  \n| Parameter | Default Example | Why It Helps |\n|-----------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Module size** | “Top 20 proteins” | Limits the expansion to a manageable set you can inspect. |\n| **Edge confidence** | “High‑confidence interactions only” | Filters out weak or low‑support links so the module stays biologically plausible. |\n\n(If you don’t adjust anything, ChatDREx will just use the built‑in defaults.)\n\n---\n\n### 5.  (Optional) Upload Your Own Data  \nSuppose you have an **RNA‑seq table** from breast‑cancer tumour samples.  \n*You’d upload a CSV file that lists expression levels for each gene.*  \nChatDREx would later colour‑code the nodes in the map to show which of the module proteins are actually over‑expressed in your samples, but we’re not running it now.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Behind‑the‑Scenes Planner Actions (No Code)  \n| Planner Action | What Happens | How ChatDREx Uses It |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **FETCH_NETWORK** | Pulls the protein‑interaction graph that covers TP53‑related pathways. | Ensures you’re looking at the right biological universe. |\n| **UPDATE_NETWORK** | Adds TP53 as a seed node and applies any edge filters you chose. | Pre‑pares the map for the algorithm. |\n| **CALL_CHATDREX_TOOL** (DIAMOnD) | Runs the community‑expansion algorithm. | Builds a small, tightly‑connected group of proteins around TP53. |\n| **CALL_DIGEST_TOOL** (optional) | Calculates GO/KEGG enrichment on the resulting module. | Gives you a quick “pathway story” of the module. |\n| **CALL_KG** | Adds drug‑target, disease‑gene, and biomarker overlays from the NeDRex knowledge‑graph. | Lets you see if any module proteins are already drug targets or known cancer drivers. |\n| **FINALIZE** | Converts raw scores and lists into tables, a short written summary, and an interactive map. | Presents the results in a user‑friendly format. |\n\n---\n\n### 7.  The Final Outputs (Hypothetical, Not Executed)  \n\n| Output | What It Looks Like | Why It’s Useful |\n|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Interactive Map** | A network graph where TP53 sits in the centre; surrounding nodes are the newly identified proteins. | You can visually spot hubs, bridges, or signaling chains. |\n| **Gene‑List Table** | 20 rows: Gene symbol, module‑membership score, literature‑link count, drug‑target link count. | Copy‑paste‑ready for your manuscript or spreadsheet. |\n| **Enrichment Summary** | “The module is significantly enriched for apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell‑cycle regulation (p < 0.001).” | Gives a quick, statistically‑validated explanation of the module’s biology. |\n| **Drug‑Target Panel** | For each module gene, a list of approved drugs, experimental drugs, and any clinical‑trial evidence. | Helps you decide which proteins to test pharmacologically. |\n| **Shareable Link / Download Buttons** | A URL you can send to collaborators; options to export CSV/PNG/PDF. | Makes it easy to share the exact workspace you just explored. |\n\n---\n\n### What You’d Do Next (If You Were Executing)\n\n1. **Ask follow‑ups** – e.g., “Do you want to include PTM‑modified proteins?”  \n2. **Adjust filters** – “Show only high‑confidence edges.”  \n3. **Run a second tool** – “Now run TrustRank on the same seed.”  \n4. **Export** – “Download the gene list as CSV.”\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nIn this hypothetical example, you simply state a question, confirm TP53 as the seed, pick DIAMOnD, and then read a tidy map, a concise summary, and a few tables. All the heavy lifting—network fetching, algorithm execution, enrichment calculations, drug overlays—is handled automatically by ChatDREx, so you’re left with a ready‑to‑share scientific story.",

  "question" : "Can you suggest a starting workflow?",
  "answer" : "## A Friendly Starting Workflow for ChatDREx  \n\nThink of ChatDREx as a **smart tour guide** for a huge “biological map.”  \nYou give it a **question** and a few starting points (genes, proteins, diseases).  \nIt then picks the right “GPS route” (DIAMOnD, TrustRank, enrichment, etc.), explores the map, and hands you a clean, readable report.  \n\nBelow is a simple, step‑by‑step workflow you can follow every time you start a new project.  \n\n---\n\n### 1.  Clarify Your Research Question  \n- **Write it in plain language.**  \n  - Example: “Which proteins cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer?”  \n- **Identify the main goal:**  \n  - *Discovery* (find new disease genes)  \n  - *Prioritization* (rank all proteins for relevance)  \n  - *Interpretation* (understand pathways or drug links)\n\n### 2.  Gather Your Starting Points (Seed Genes)  \n- **List any known genes, proteins, or biomarkers** relevant to your question.  \n  - Separate them with commas or new lines.  \n- If you have a **gene list from an experiment** (RNA‑seq, proteomics), you can use that as the seed set.\n\n### 3.  Decide Which Analysis You Want  \n| Goal | Suggested Tool | What It Gives You |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Find a tight, disease‑related community** | **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | A small, highly‑connected module around your seeds. |\n| **Rank the entire network for relevance** | **TrustRank** | A list of all proteins scored by how “trustworthy” they are to your seeds. |\n| **Understand the biology of a list** | **Digest (enrichment)** | GO/KEGG pathway over‑representation stats for the gene set. |\n| **Link to drugs or clinical data** | **KG overlay** (built‑in in the GUI) | Drug–target associations, disease links, clinical trials. |\n\n### 4.  Set Optional Parameters (if you want more control)  \n- **Module size** (e.g., top 20 proteins).  \n- **Edge confidence** (filter weak interactions).  \n- **Damping factor** for TrustRank (controls how far “trust” spreads).  \n\nIf you’re just starting, the default settings usually work well.\n\n### 5.  (Optional) Add Your Own Data  \n- Upload a CSV/TSV/Excel file with your own expression, mutation, or PTM data.  \n- This lets ChatDREx colour‑code the map so you can see which module proteins are active in your samples.\n\n### 6.  Review and Confirm  \n- ChatDREx will show you the seeds it detected and the analysis it’s about to run.  \n- Confirm or tweak them if needed—no need to type any commands.\n\n### 7.  Run the Analysis (automatically)  \n- The system pulls the relevant network, runs the chosen algorithm, and does enrichment for you.  \n- You’ll see an **interactive map** and a **summary table** pop up.\n\n### 8.  Explore the Results  \n- **Click nodes** to see drug links, literature references, or disease associations.  \n- **Use the sidebar panels**:  \n  - Enrichment → GO/KEGG terms and significance.  \n  - Drug‑Target → approved and experimental drugs.  \n  - More Analyses → try another tool on the same seed set.\n\n### 9.  Save and Share  \n- **Export**:  \n  - CSV for gene lists, PDF for a static report, PNG for a snapshot of the map.  \n- **Copy the shareable URL** so collaborators can open the same workspace.\n\n### 10.  Iterate  \n- Adjust parameters, add more seeds, or switch to a different analysis type.  \n- Each time you run a new step, ChatDREx gives you a fresh view of the map.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick One‑Turn Example (in Plain Text)\n\n```\nYou: \"I want to find proteins that cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer.\"\nChatDREx: Detects TP53, confirms as seed.\nChatDREx: Suggests DIAMOnD for a tight module.\nChatDREx: Runs DIAMOnD → shows 20‑protein module map.\nChatDREx: Adds enrichment → GO terms: apoptosis, DNA repair.\nChatDREx: Provides drug overlay → lists drugs targeting module proteins.\n```\n\nThat’s it! You now have a ready‑to‑share summary and a clear map of the biological story. Feel free to repeat the workflow with different questions or seed sets—ChatDREx will handle the rest. Happy exploring!",

  "question" : "What should I try as a first experiment?",
  "answer" : "## A “Starter Experiment” that Gives You a Quick, Tangible Insight\n\nIf this is your **first time using ChatDREx**, pick something that\n\n1. is **well‑known** (so the system already has plenty of data about it),  \n2. lets you see the *full power* of the three core workflows (module building, ranking, and biological interpretation), and  \n3. yields a **ready‑to‑share report** you can use in a paper, a slide deck, or a quick discussion with a colleague.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Experiment: “Discover the TP53‑Cooperating Network in Breast Cancer”\n\n| What you’ll do | Why it’s a good first experiment |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Seed** – TP53 (the most‑studied tumor‑suppressor gene). | The system recognises TP53 automatically; it’s a common starting point for many projects. |\n| **Analysis** – DIAMOnD (Diamond). | Builds a tight, disease‑related community around TP53 – exactly what you want to “discover” first. |\n| **Optional** – Enrichment (Digest). | Gives you a quick GO/KEGG “story” of the module so you can talk about biology right away. |\n| **Overlay** – Drug‑Target & Disease‑Gene links from the KG. | Shows whether any module proteins are already drug targets or implicated in breast cancer, making the result immediately actionable. |\n| **Output** – Interactive map + gene‑list table + enrichment summary. | You get a complete, shareable package in a single click. |\n\n---\n\n## How to Run It (in Plain Conversation)\n\n1. **Ask**  \n   ```\n   You: \"What proteins cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer?\"\n   ```\n2. **Confirm the seed** – TP53 will be auto‑detected; just click “Confirm.”\n3. **Choose the analysis** – “DIAMOnD (Diamond) for a tight module” (the system can offer the option; you pick it).\n4. **Hit Enter** – ChatDREx automatically pulls the breast‑cancer‑focused interactome, runs DIAMOnD, performs enrichment, and overlays drug/disease data.\n5. **Explore** –  \n   * Click on any node to see known drugs or clinical‑trial evidence.  \n   * In the sidebar, view the GO/KEGG enrichment table (e.g., “DNA repair”, “Apoptosis” significant).  \n   * Download the gene list or the full PDF report.\n\n---\n\n### Why This is a Great First Experiment\n\n| Feature | Benefit |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Known gene** – TP53 | You’re 100 % sure the seed is biologically relevant. |\n| **DIAMOnD module** | Gives you a concise, interpretable set of proteins to discuss. |\n| **Built‑in enrichment** | Immediately tells you *why* the module matters (apoptosis, DNA repair…). |\n| **Drug overlay** | Turns biology into a drug‑target list – perfect for a quick “repurposing idea”. |\n| **No coding** | You just type a sentence; all the heavy lifting is invisible. |\n| **Shareable link** | You can hand the exact workspace to a colleague or a journal reviewer. |\n\n---\n\n### If You Want a Slight Twist\n\n*Add your own data* – if you have an RNA‑seq file from breast‑cancer tumours, upload it and colour‑code the module proteins that are actually up‑regulated. That gives a more personal, sample‑specific story.\n\n---\n\n**So, the simplest “first experiment” to try is**:  \n> **Discover and interpret a TP53‑centric disease module in breast cancer** using DIAMOnD, followed by enrichment and drug overlay.\n\nThis will give you a clean network, a concise biological narrative, and actionable drug targets—all ready to share or build on in later experiments.

  "question" : "How can I use this interface effectively?",
  "answer" : "## How to Make the Most of the ChatDREx UI  \nThink of the interface as a **high‑performance workstation**: you set up your “experiment” in the left‑sidebar, the heart of the analysis runs in the central graph, and the right‑sidebar gives you quick answers and export options. Below are practical tips that let you navigate the UI like a pro.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Start With a Clear Question  \n- **Write a concise, specific query** (e.g., “What proteins cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer?”).  \n- The system will highlight key terms; you can edit them if the automatic detection picks something off.\n\n> **Pro tip:** If you’re unsure, begin with a *generic* seed (TP53, BRCA1) and let the UI suggest a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Build Your Seed Set Strategically  \n- **Auto‑detect**: After you type your question, the UI will list suggested seed genes.  \n- **Add manually**: Drag a list from a CSV or type in the “Add Seed” box.  \n- **Check synonyms**: The system will show alternative names (e.g., “p53” for TP53).\n\n> **Why it matters** – The seed set defines the “anchor” of your network exploration. A well‑chosen seed set yields a more focused module.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Choose the Right Workflow  \n| Workflow | When to Pick It | What to Expect |\n|----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | You want a *tight, biologically coherent module* around your seeds. | Iteratively builds a module, adding the most “linker” proteins first. |\n| **TrustRank** | You want a *global ranking* of all genes in the network relative to your seeds. | Produces a score for every node; useful for drug‑target prioritization. |\n| **Digest (Enrichment)** | You already have a gene list and want biological context. | Generates GO/KEGG/DO over‑representation results. |\n\n> **Tip:** Try DIAMOnD first, then run TrustRank on the same seed set to see both module and global ranking.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Fine‑Tune Parameters (Optional, but Powerful)  \n- **Module size** (DIAMOnD): Bigger modules capture more interactions but may introduce noise.  \n- **Edge confidence**: Set the minimum interaction confidence; 0.8 is a safe default.  \n- **Damping factor** (TrustRank): Controls how quickly scores decay across the network.  \n\n> **Best practice:** Keep defaults for your first run; experiment with different values after you understand how they influence the results.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Overlay Layers for Actionable Insight  \n- **Drug‑Target**: Toggle to see which module proteins already have approved drugs or experimental compounds.  \n- **Disease‑Gene**: Highlight genes that literature links to breast cancer (or your disease of interest).  \n- **Biomarker**: If you upload expression data, these nodes will light up with sample‑specific color codes.\n\n> **Why overlay?** – It turns a pure network into a *therapeutic map* you can share with collaborators or your journal reviewer.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Upload Sample‑Specific Data (Whenever You Have It)  \n- Drag a CSV/TSV/Excel file into the “Upload Data” section.  \n- The data will **colour‑code** nodes (e.g., red for over‑expressed, blue for under‑expressed).  \n- Use a single‑column gene list or a multi‑column expression matrix; the UI will ask you to map columns if needed.\n\n> **Result:** You get a personalised “heat‑map” of the module, making it easier to spot clinically relevant patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Interactive Exploration – The Central Graph is Your Playground  \n| Action | What Happens | How to Use It |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Click a node** | A card pops up with PubMed links, drug links, disease annotations, and PTM status. | Quick fact‑check on any protein. |\n| **Zoom/Pan** | Mouse wheel or drag. | Zoom into a dense hub or pull back to see the whole module. |\n| **Drag filters** | Hide weak edges or focus on breast‑cancer interactions. | Removes visual clutter. |\n| **Node size/colour** | Adjusted automatically by module score or your own data. | Highlights hubs or genes of interest. |\n\n> **Visualization tip:** Turn on “Edge Confidence” filtering if you feel the graph is too cluttered. The overlay toggles (Drug‑Target, Disease‑Gene) can also be turned off to declutter.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Read the Right‑Sidebar Panels Like a Storyline  \n- **Gene‑List Table**: Copy‑paste the list into Excel for downstream stats.  \n- **Enrichment**: Look for the most significant GO/KEGG terms – these give you the *biological narrative* of your module.  \n- **Drug‑Target**: Spot any approved drugs or clinical‑trial candidates.  \n- **Literature**: Quick PubMed abstracts for the node you’re hovering over.\n\n> **Sharing hack:** Use the “Download → PDF” button to get a ready‑made report with all panels included. The PDF keeps the colours and layout intact.\n\n---\n\n### 8.  Save, Export, and Share  \n- **Export CSV**: Gene‑list or enrichment tables.  \n- **Export PNG**: Static map snapshot for slide decks.  \n- **Download PDF**: A full, printable report with all panels.  \n- **Copy Shareable Link**: Anyone with the URL sees exactly the same workspace – perfect for peer review or collaboration.\n\n---\n\n### 9.  Keep a Workflow Notebook  \n- **Undo / Redo**: Handy if you accidentally turn a filter on/off.  \n- **Reset Workspace**: Clear everything and start fresh when you change your experimental question.  \n- **Help/Tutorial**: A pop‑up with quick tips is available at any time.\n\n> **Workflow idea:**  \n> 1. **Question → Seeds → DIAMOnD → Enrichment → Export**  \n> 2. **Add Overlay → TrustRank → Export PDF**  \n\n---\n\n## Quick “Cheat Sheet” for One‑Click Success  \n\n| UI Element | Typical Click | What You See | Explanation |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Top‑Bar textbox** | Type “What proteins cooperate with TP53 in breast cancer?” | Highlighted terms | Automatic seed suggestion |\n| **Left‑Sidebar “Add Seed”** | Type “TP53, BRCA1” or upload CSV | Seed list | Anchor of analysis |\n| **Workflow dropdown** | Select DIAMOnD | Module‑building interface | Build a coherent module |\n| **Parameters sliders** | Adjust module size to 20 | Larger modules = more noise | Fine‑tune granularity |\n| **Upload Data** | Drag a CSV of breast‑cancer expression | Colour‑coded nodes | Sample‑specific context |\n| **Run button** | Click | Algorithm executes | Backend processing explained by me |\n| **Central Graph** | Click node → pop‑up | Literature, drug links | Quick fact‑check |\n| **Right‑Sidebar “Enrichment”** | View GO/KEGG | p‑values, FDR | Biological context |\n| **Right‑Sidebar “Drug‑Target”** | View drug list | Approved drugs, trials | Therapeutic insights |\n| **Download → PDF** | Export report | All panels in one PDF | Shareable, printable |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought  \nUse the **left‑sidebar** to set up, the **central graph** to *visualise*, and the **right‑sidebar** to *interpret and export*. Treat each panel as a piece of a larger puzzle:\n\n1. **Question → Seeds → Workflow**  \n2. **Parameters → Data (optional)**  \n3. **Run**  \n4. **Explore → Interpret → Share**\n\nFollow this loop, tweak one variable at a time, and you’ll quickly discover the most powerful ways the ChatDREx UI can help you answer your research questions.

  "answer" : "## Conceptual Discoveries You Can Make With ChatDREx\n\n| # | What You Can Uncover | Why It Matters | How It Looks |\n|---|----------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **1. Hidden disease modules** | Find a tightly‑connected “community” of proteins that work together in a specific disease. | Shows the core machinery that drives the pathology—great for biomarker or drug‑target hunting. | A small, well‑connected cluster that sprouts from your seed genes. |\n| **2. Key “linker” proteins** | Identify proteins that connect otherwise separate groups of disease genes. | These are the “bridge” nodes that may be critical regulators or vulnerabilities. | A node that sits between two otherwise unconnected clusters. |\n| **3. Prioritized candidate list** | Rank **every** protein in the network by how “trustworthy” it is relative to your seeds. | Gives you a short list of promising genes—even those a few steps away from your known hits. | A global ranking table, with the highest scores at the top. |\n| **4. Functional themes** | Test whether your gene list is enriched for particular biological processes, pathways, or diseases. | Turns a raw list into biological insight—e.g., “immune response” or “metabolic signaling.” | A bar chart or table of GO/KEGG terms with statistical significance. |\n| **5. Drug‑target opportunities** | Overlay known drugs on the module or ranked list to see which existing drugs hit your network. | Spot drug repurposing possibilities or missing therapeutic gaps. | A colored map of drugs on top of the network, or a list of drug‑gene pairs. |\n| **6. Disease overlap** | Compare modules from two different diseases to see shared proteins or pathways. | Reveals common mechanisms or potential cross‑disease therapies. | Two side‑by‑side modules with highlighted intersection genes. |\n| **7. Temporal dynamics** | (If you upload time‑course data) see how hub proteins change over time during a process. | Helps pinpoint when a protein is most critical (e.g., early vs. late infection). | Heat‑mapped node colors changing across time points. |\n| **8. Post‑translational modification (PTM) hubs** | Filter the network to show only proteins that are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, etc., and rank them. | Highlights signaling or regulatory checkpoints that might be druggable. | A sub‑network of PTM‑positive nodes, ranked by centrality. |\n| **9. Novel biomarker candidates** | Combine module analysis with expression data to spot proteins that are both highly connected and highly differentially expressed. | Generates a high‑confidence list of molecules that could be measured in a lab or clinic. | A scatter plot of connectivity vs. expression fold‑change. |\n| **10. Network topology insights** | Learn about overall network properties: clustering coefficient, path lengths, hub‑spoke patterns. | Provides a systems‑level view that informs drug design and robustness studies. | Summary statistics and simple visualizations of the whole map. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom‑Line\n\n- **From seeds** → **module or ranking** → **enrichment** → **drug overlay**.  \n- Each step gives a different conceptual angle: who’s working together, who connects the dots, who’s the most promising target, what biological story the data tells, and where existing therapies fit.  \n\nThese conceptual discoveries turn raw gene lists and interaction data into actionable biological narratives—exactly what ChatDREx is built to help you uncover.",

  "answer" : "## How to Ask a Question that Gets You the Best ChatDREx Guidance  \n\n| Step | What to Say | Why It Helps |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| **1. State the *goal* in plain language** | “I want to find potential drug targets for Alzheimer’s disease.” | The system needs to know **what you’re after** – discovery, prioritization, interpretation, etc. |\n| **2. List your *seed genes* (or data)** | “My seeds are APOE, TREM2, and CLU.” | Seeds are the starting points for the network walk. |\n| **3. Mention the *analysis type** you’re interested in** | “Use DIAMOnD to build a module.” or “Use TrustRank to get a ranked list.” | Pick the right algorithm; you can ask for one or multiple. |\n| **4. Add any *filters or parameters** you care about** | “Keep the module size at 20 nodes” or “Only include proteins with a known phosphorylation site.” | Fine‑tunes the result without overcomplicating the request. |\n| **5. Specify *enrichment or annotation** you’d like** | “After the module, run GO/KEGG enrichment.” | Gives you biological context. |\n| **6. (Optional) Provide your own data** | “I have a CSV of gene‑expression values; please overlay it on the module.” | Lets ChatDREx integrate your measurements. |\n| **7. Ask for a *deliverable format**** | “Export the final list as CSV and the graph as PNG.” | Makes downstream sharing easy. |\n| **8. Keep it concise** | Combine the above into one sentence or a short paragraph. | Reduces back‑and‑forth; the system parses your request faster. |\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Well‑Framed Prompt\n\n> “I’m studying Alzheimer’s disease. Using the seeds **APOE, TREM2, CLU**, build a disease module with DIAMOnD (target size 15). After the module is created, perform GO/KEGG enrichment and overlay any supplied expression data. Export the gene list as CSV and the network diagram as PNG.”\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n- **Be specific but not overly technical** – “module” vs. “network ranking” matters.  \n- **Mention the *type* of network layer** (protein‑interaction, drug‑target, literature) if you want an overlay.  \n- **Include literature or drug overlay requests** if you need that context.  \n- **If you’re unsure about parameters**, let the defaults run; you can always tweak later.\n\nFollow this recipe, and ChatDREx will understand exactly what you need, run the right workflow, and hand you results that are ready for analysis, presentation, or publication.

  "answer" : "## Demo Walk‑Through: How ChatDREx Turns a Question Into Insight  \n\nLet’s imagine you’re a scientist who wants to know **“What proteins might be good drug targets for Alzheimer’s disease?”**  \nWe’ll follow the exact path ChatDREx would take, step‑by‑step, as if we were watching a movie unfold. No code, no results—just the story.\n\n---\n\n### 1. You Tell ChatDREx Your Goal  \n**Prompt you type:**  \n> “I want to find drug‑target candidates for Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\n**What happens behind the scenes:**  \n- ChatDREx reads the sentence, grabs the key phrase *Alzheimer’s disease*, and asks: “Do you have any genes or proteins that you already suspect?”  \n- If you don’t give any, it asks you to enter a few seed genes (e.g., *APOE, TREM2, CLU*).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. The System Builds the Map  \n**Think of the biological network as a huge city map.**  \n- Each node = a protein or gene.  \n- Each edge = a physical or functional interaction.  \n- The map is loaded from a curated database of protein‑protein interactions (the “road network” for our story).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Choosing the Right GPS Engine  \nChatDREx chooses a **“GPS engine”** based on what you want:  \n- **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** if you want a tight neighbourhood around the seeds—a *disease module*.  \n- **TrustRank** if you want a global ranking of all proteins by how closely they’re tied to the seeds.\n\nFor this demo, we’ll pick **DIAMOnD** because you want to discover a focused set of proteins that could be drug targets.\n\n---\n\n### 4. DIAMOnD (The Community Finder) Works Its Magic  \n\n1. **Start with Seeds**  \n   - Place *APOE, TREM2, CLU* on the map.  \n2. **Iteratively Add the Best New Node**  \n   - Look at every protein that touches the current cluster.  \n   - For each candidate, count how many connections it makes **to the entire growing cluster** (not just to the seeds).  \n   - Pick the protein with the most statistically significant connections (i.e., the best “linker”).  \n3. **Repeat**  \n   - Add that protein to the cluster.  \n   - Go back to step 2 and keep adding until you reach a pre‑set size (say 15 proteins).  \n\n**Result:** A small, highly connected community of proteins that are likely involved in the same biological processes as your seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Add a “What‑If” Layer – Drug Overlays  \nWith the module built, ChatDREx can **overlay drug information**:  \n\n- It pulls a list of FDA‑approved drugs that directly bind to any protein in the module.  \n- It displays those drugs next to their target nodes in the graph.  \n\n**Why this matters:** You can immediately spot whether any of the proteins are already druggable or if new targets exist.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Interpret the Module – Functional Enrichment  \nNext, ChatDREx runs **Digest** (the enrichment engine):  \n\n- It compares the module’s genes to a curated library of biological pathways (GO, KEGG).  \n- It highlights processes that are over‑represented (e.g., “immune response”, “lipid transport”).  \n\n**In plain terms:** Digest tells you *what the module is doing* in a language you can read in a table or a bar chart, rather than a cryptic list of gene names.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Final Deliverables  \nYou can ask for easy‑to‑share files:  \n\n- **CSV** – a list of the 15 module proteins, their degree (how many connections), and any drugs that hit them.  \n- **PNG** – a snapshot of the network you can paste into a slide deck.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. You Review and Share  \n- Click a node → quick card appears: protein function, literature links, drug status.  \n- Hover over the enrichment table → you see the top pathways.  \n- Export everything you need.  \n\n---\n\n### Recap of the Story\n\n| Step | What You Saw | What You Learned |\n|------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Goal** | “Find drug targets for Alzheimer’s.” | ChatDREx asks for seeds. |\n| **Map** | Huge protein interaction city. | Provides context. |\n| **GPS Engine** | DIAMOnD = find tight neighbourhood. | Focused discovery. |\n| **DIAMOnD** | 15‑protein community. | Core disease machinery. |\n| **Drug Overlay** | FDA drugs next to targets. | Immediate drug‑ability check. |\n| **Digest (Enrichment)** | Over‑represented pathways. | Biological interpretation. |\n| **Export** | CSV + PNG. | Shareable data. |\n\n---\n\n### What You Get in a Real Session  \n\n- **A tidy graph** that shows the module, drug overlays, and a color‑coded importance ranking.  \n- **Tables** listing each protein, how many connections it has, any drugs that hit it, and which pathways it participates in.  \n- **Literature links** that let you dive deeper into each protein’s role in Alzheimer’s.  \n\n---\n\nThat’s the **demo explanation** of a typical ChatDREx workflow.  \nYou, the scientist, tell it what you want in plain language; it selects the right algorithms, builds a focused module, layers drug and literature context, interprets the biology, and hands you ready‑to‑share files—all without you touching a line of code.",

Find a Disease Module (DIAMOnD / Diamond)** | • Start from a few “seed” genes (e.g., APOE, TREM2, CLU).<br>• Grow a tightly‑connected neighbourhood that is statistically enriched for shared interactions.<br>• Highlight the “linker” proteins that make the module most robust. | A small, highly‑connected community that probably drives the disease process. |\n| **3. Rank Everything (TrustRank)** | • Score every protein in the whole map by how closely it’s tied to your seeds.<br>• Produce a global priority list (the most “trust‑worthy” proteins). | A single table that tells you which proteins are worth investigating next. |\n| **4. Interpret Gene Lists (Digest)** | • Upload any gene or protein list.<br>• Run GO, KEGG, ClinVar, and other annotations in one go.<br>• Show over‑represented biological processes and pathways. | A tidy table of the biological meaning behind any list you hand over. |\n| **5. Overlay Drugs & Literature** | • Map FDA‑approved or clinical‑trial drugs onto the network (drug‑target pairs).<br>• Add literature citations, PubMed links, and clinical association tags next to each node. | Immediate “drug‑ability” checks and quick literature references. |\n| **6. Comparative / Cross‑Disease Analysis** | • Build modules for two diseases side‑by‑side.<br>• Compare shared proteins, hubs, and pathways.<br>• Identify common druggable intersections. | Understand shared mechanisms between conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s vs. Parkinson’s). |\n| **7. Two‑Hop & Pathway Exploration** | • Find the strongest two‑hop connection between any two proteins.<br>• Pull out the top two‑hop paths in a pathway of interest. | Clarify how distant genes might talk to each other. |\n| **8.

  "answer" : "## Step‑by‑Step Example  \n**Goal:** Find a small, disease‑related module around the genes **APOE** and **TREM2** (common Alzheimer’s risk genes) and see which biological pathways are enriched.\n\n> **Tip:** Think of the protein network as a city map, and your seeds (APOE, TREM2) as two landmarks. We’ll use two GPS tools—**Diamond** (to find a tight neighbourhood) and **Digest** (to interpret the neighbourhood).\n\n| # | What to Do | What You’ll See | Why It Matters |\n|---|------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **1. Create a New Project** | 1️⃣ Click **“New Analysis”** (or the “+” icon). 2️⃣ Name it *Alzheimer Module* and click **Create**. | A fresh workspace appears with empty tabs. | Keeps your work organized and reproducible. |\n| **2. Add Seed Genes** | 1️⃣ Open the **“Seeds”** tab. 2️⃣ In the textbox, type `APOE, TREM2` (comma‑separated). 3️⃣ Hit **Add**. | The two genes show up in a list. | These are the “landmarks” that guide the analysis. |\n| **3. Load the Human Protein Network** | 1️⃣ Go to the **“Network”** tab. 2️⃣ Ensure the switch says **“Human PPI”** (the default). 3️⃣ Click **Refresh** if it’s grey. | The entire network loads (≈ 20 k proteins, 100 k edges). | Provides the “map” on which everything else runs. |\n| **4. Run DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | 1️⃣ Click the **“Analysis”** menu → choose **DIAMOnD**. 2️⃣ Set the module size to **15** (you’ll get a 15‑protein module). 3️⃣ Hit **Run**. | A graph pops up showing a tight cluster around APOE/TREM2. | Diamond finds the most tightly‑connected community, revealing possible “linker” proteins. |\n| **5. Inspect the Module** | 1️⃣ Hover over nodes to see quick cards (gene name, function, literature links). 2️⃣ Click on a node to open its full card. 3️⃣ Use the **Zoom** tools to focus on the core. | You’ll spot proteins like **BIN1**, **CLU**, **SORL1** that are known Alzheimer’s genes. | Confirms that the algorithm is picking biologically relevant partners. |\n| **6. Run Digest (Enrichment)** | 1️⃣ In the **“Results”** panel, click the **“Digest”** tab. 2️⃣ Ensure the gene list is set to “Module genes”. 3️⃣ Click **Run**. | A table of enriched GO terms, KEGG pathways, and FDR‑adjusted p‑values appears. | Tells you what biological processes the module is involved in (e.g., “lipid transport”, “phagocytosis”). |\n| **7. Interpret the Pathways** | 1️⃣ Look at the top 5 enriched categories. 2️⃣ Click on a category name to see which genes drive it. | You might see “Apolipoprotein transport”, “Microglial activation”, “Endocytosis”. | Gives you a hypothesis‑ready list of mechanisms to follow up in experiments. |\n| **7. Export the Findings** | 1️⃣ At the bottom of the **Digest** table, click **Export** → choose **CSV**. 2️⃣ In the pop‑up, keep “Gene list” and “Enrichment table” selected. 3️⃣ Click **Download**. | You now have a CSV file you can copy into a slide or paper. | Makes your results shareable without extra formatting. |\n| **8. Save the Project** | 1️⃣ Click the **Save** icon (floppy‑disk) in the top bar. 2️⃣ Confirm you want to autosave. | All your seeds, network state, module graph, and enrichment table are now stored. | Guarantees you can revisit or give a colleague the exact same view later. |\n\n### Quick Summary of the Whole Workflow\n\n1. **Project → Seeds → Network** – set up the city map and landmarks.  \n2. **DIAMOnD** – pull the GPS to find a dense neighbourhood.  \n3. **Module inspection** – walk through the neighbourhood, read node cards.  \n4. **Digest** – interpret the neighbourhood with pathway “labels”.  \n5. **Export** – grab a ready‑to‑use table or network picture.\n\nFeel free to tweak any parameter (e.g., module size 20, add a third seed **CLU**, or switch to TrustRank for a global ranking) and see how the results change.

  "answer" : "**Here’s a “walk‑through” of a cool, *conceptual* exploration you can do with ChatDREx—no real data or execution, just the idea of what you could investigate.**\n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFAF Hypothetical Exploration: “Finding Novel Drug Targets for Early‑Stage Parkinson’s Disease”\n\n### 1. **Start with a Clear Question**\n> *“Which proteins, beyond the well‑known LRRK2 and SNCA, might be key hubs in Parkinson’s disease and could be druggable?”*\n\nThis is the *research question* that will guide everything else.\n\n### 2. **Choose Your Seeds (Starting Points)**\n- **Known Parkinson genes** (seed list): `LRRK2`, `SNCA`, `PARK7`, `PRKN`, `GBA`.\n- These are the “anchors” you’ll ask the network to expand from.\n\n### 3. **Select the Right Map (Biological Terrain)**\n- **Human Protein‑Protein Interaction (PPI) Network** – the default map.\n- If you want a more focused view, switch to a **PTM‑filtered PPI** that highlights phosphorylation interactions, because many Parkinson proteins are regulated by phosphorylation.\n\n### 4. **Pick a Lens (What Tool to Use)**\n| Lens | What it Does | Why It Fits This Question |\n|------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | Builds a tight “module” around your seeds, adding the most statistically connected proteins iteratively. | It’ll reveal a compact cluster of Parkinson‑related proteins, making it easier to spot drug‑gable hubs. |\n| **TrustRank** | Ranks *all* proteins by how “relevant” they are to your seeds, even if they’re a few steps away. | Useful if you want to spot distant players that DIAMOnD might miss, e.g., proteins linked to inflammation that influence Parkinson’s progression. |\n| **Digest (Enrichment)** | Gives you GO/KEGG terms for any gene list. | After you get the module, you can run Digest to see which pathways (e.g., “autophagy”, “mitochondrial dysfunction”) the cluster belongs to. |\n\n> **For this example, start with DIAMOnD** to get a focused module.  \n> Then, optionally, run TrustRank on the *same* seeds to see how the module proteins rank in the whole human proteome.\n\n### 5. **Explore the Resulting Graph (What to Look For)**\n1. **Identify Hubs** – proteins with many connections inside the module (high degree).  \n   *Hypothetical examples:* `VCP`, `STUB1`, `DCTN1`.\n2. **Spot Bridge Proteins** – nodes that connect two seed‑rich sub‑clusters.  \n   *Potential bridge:* `PRDX2` (involved in oxidative stress).\n3. **Overlay Drug Nodes** – once the module is drawn, add an overlay of FDA‑approved drugs.  \n   *Goal:* see if any known drugs already target one of the newly highlighted proteins.\n4. **Add an Omics Overlay** (optional concept) – imagine you have early‑stage patient transcriptomics. You could visualize expression levels on the same module to see which proteins are *up‑regulated* and therefore “hot” candidates for therapy.\n\n### 6. **Enrichment for Biological Context**\n- After you’d have the module list, run **Digest** to check which GO/KEGG terms dominate.  \n  *Typical hits might be “mitochondrial organization” or “protein degradation”—key Parkinson pathways.*\n\n### 7. **What to Do Next? (Iterative Loop)**\n- **Add a new seed** (e.g., a protein you read about in a recent review) and rerun DIAMOnD.  \n- **Adjust module size** (grow to 50 proteins) to see if the module still stays coherent.  \n- **Switch to TrustRank** to rank the entire proteome, then cross‑reference the top 10% with the DIAMOnD module to look for overlap—those proteins are “central” *and* “relevant” globally.\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCA1 What Makes This Exploration “Interesting”\n\n- **Discovery potential** – The module may contain proteins you’ve never linked to Parkinson’s before, opening new research avenues.\n- **Drug‑repurposing hook** – Overlaid drug nodes can highlight existing drugs that could be tested in Parkinson models.\n- **Biological narrative** – Enrichment terms will tell you whether the module is enriched for neuronal signaling, mitochondrial function, or other Parkinson‑relevant processes.\n\n---\n\n### How to Turn This Into a Real Project\n\n1. Create a new project titled *Parkinson_Module*.  \n2. Add the seed list (`LRRK2`, `SNCA`, …).  \n3. Keep the default Human PPI map (or switch to PTM‑filtered if you want to focus on phosphorylation).  \n4. Run DIAMOnD with a module size of ~30 proteins.  \n5. (Optional) Overlay drugs and run Digest on the module list.  \n6. Explore the graph, look at node cards, and export the gene list or graph for a publication.\n\n**No actual execution is needed for this “show‑me‑something‑interesting” idea—just the steps you would take when you’re ready to dive in.**",

Pick a disease / pathway you care about** | Choose one that you already have a handful of known genes for (e.g., *Alzheimer’s*, *breast cancer*, *immune‑mediated arthritis*). | You’ll have a ready‑made seed list. |\n| **2. Gather the seed genes** | Write a short list of 3‑10 genes that are already proven to be involved in that disease.  Example for Alzheimer’s: `APOE`, `PSEN1`, `PSEN2`, `TREM2`. | Seeds give the network a concrete anchor. |\n| **3. Choose the Human (or Mouse) PPI map** | Start with the default **Human Protein‑Protein Interaction** map. | It’s the most complete “terrain” and works for any human‑based question. |\n| **4. Choose the analysis lens** |  • **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** – build a tight module around your seeds.  <br>• **TrustRank** – rank all proteins by relevance to those seeds. |  • DIAMOnD gives you a focused cluster you can visualise.  <br>• TrustRank adds a genome‑wide perspective so you can spot distant players. |\n| **5. Run an enrichment check (Digest)** | After you get the module or ranking list, click “Run Digest” (GO/KEGG). | It will tell you whether the proteins you see belong to the expected biological processes. |\n| **6. (Optional) Overlay drugs** | Click **Overlay Drugs** on the graph. | You’ll instantly see if any FDA‑approved drugs hit one of your new candidates. |\n\n**Putting it together in a single sentence**\n\n> “Start by writing a 5‑gene seed list for *Alzheimer’s* (e.g., `APOE`, `PSEN1`, `TREM2`, `APP`, `BIN1`), load the default Human PPI map, run **DIAMOnD** with a module size of ~25 proteins, then explore the resulting graph and run Digest on the module to check which pathways are enriched.”\n\nThat’s the most straightforward, conceptually clear entry point that works for almost any research question. Good luck!",

  "answer" : "### How to Experiment Safely with ChatDREx  \n*(All the tips below are about **how you use the platform, not about what the system does behind the scenes.)*\n\n| # | Safe‑Experimentation Practice | Why It Matters |\n|---|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| **1. Keep Sensitive Data Out** | Never upload personally identifying patient info, clinical trial details, or proprietary genomic sequences. | Protect privacy, comply with HIPAA/GDPR, and avoid accidental data leaks. |\n| **2. Use Dummy or Synthetic Sets First** | Start with a small, made‑up gene list (e.g., `GENE1`, `GENE2`) or a publicly available dataset. | Lets you see how the workflow works without risking real data exposure. |\n| **3. Verify Your Seeding** | Check that the seed symbols match the database (UniProt/Ensembl). Mis‑spelled names can silently pull in unrelated nodes. | Reduces noise and mis‑interpretation of results. |\n| **4. Review Map Selection** | Confirm you’re on the correct organism and interaction map (Human vs. Mouse, PTM‑filtered vs. full). | Wrong map can skew results and make them irrelevant to your biology. |\n| **5. Limit Iterations or Module Size** | When running DIAMOnD, choose a small target size (e.g., 10–20 proteins) until you’re comfortable with the output. | Prevents runaway analysis that could consume too many resources or produce an unwieldy graph. |\n| **6. Inspect Intermediate Results** | After each step (network load, DIAMOnD, TrustRank), preview the graph and table summaries before proceeding. | Helps catch errors early and avoid unnecessary downstream work. |\n| **7. Keep a Copy of Your Settings** | Record the seed list, map choice, algorithm parameters, and any overlays you use. | Enables reproducibility and safe rollback if something goes wrong. |\n| **8. Use the Export Features** | Export gene lists or graph snapshots as CSV/PNG for local inspection and documentation. | Keeps a record outside the system, which is useful for audit trails. |\n| **9. Avoid Sharing Sensitive Projects Publicly** | When sharing a project link, ensure it’s only given to trusted collaborators and that the project doesn’t contain private data. | Protects intellectual property and data security. |\n| **10. Read the Platform’s Privacy Policy** | Understand how your uploads are stored, who can access them, and what retention policies exist. | Informs you of the platform’s data‑handling commitments. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nTreat your first experiments like a sandbox: start small, use synthetic data, keep track of every setting, and double‑check each output before moving on. Once you feel confident, you can gradually swap in real, anonymised datasets while still following the same safety checklist. Happy, secure exploration!",

Make a small seed list** | Pick 3‑5 genes you already know are disease‑relevant (e.g., for Parkinson’s: `LRRK2`, `SNCA`, `GBA`). | A tiny seed list keeps the module readable and guarantees the network will focus on your biology. |\n| **2. Load the default Human PPI map** | Use the “Human Protein‑Protein Interaction” terrain. | It’s the most complete map and works for any human question. |\n| **3. Run **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** with a target size of ~20‑25 proteins** | Conceptually: “Expand from my seeds to build a tight disease‑module.” | You’ll get a compact, interpretable cluster in one click. |\n| **4. Visualise the graph** | Look at the nodes, read the quick node cards (literature, annotations). | Spot obvious hubs or bridge proteins right away. |\n| **5. Run **Digest** on the module** | Get a GO/KEGG/Reactome table for the module genes. | Confirms you’re seeing the biology you expect (e.g., “mitochondrial dysfunction”). |\n| **6. (Optional) Overlay drugs** | Add the drug overlay on the graph. | Immediately see if any FDA‑approved drugs hit one of your new candidates. |\n\n**Why start here?**\n\n- **Fast feedback loop** – you’ll see a focused cluster and functional themes in a single run.  \n- **Clear visual output** – a graph you can hover, click, and annotate without having to juggle many panels.  \n- **Translational hook** – the drug overlay instantly tells you if the newly highlighted proteins are already druggable.\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with this basic view, you can start experimenting with TrustRank, adding omics overlays, or pulling in KG links— but the DIAMOnD ➜ Digest chain is the most direct way to “see the biology” right from the get‑go.",

  "question" : "What's the scope of this tool?",
  "answer" : "### Scope of ChatDREx – What it Can Do (and What it Can’t)  \n\n| Area | What ChatDREx Offers | Why It Matters | Typical Limitations |\n|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **Human (and mouse) Protein Interaction Maps** | Visualize known physical contacts between proteins in the human or mouse genome. | Enables discovery of disease‑related communities. | Depends on the completeness of public PPI data; missing or spurious edges can skew results. |\n| **Seed‑Based Module Expansion (DIAMOnD / Diamond)** | Builds tight, disease‑specific clusters around a few known genes. | Reveals key players, bridge proteins, and hub targets. | The module size is limited by the map’s density; too many seeds can make the module hard to interpret. |\n| **Genome‑wide Ranking (TrustRank)** | Provides an ordered list of all proteins by relevance to your seeds. | Gives a broader context and highlights distant but important proteins. | Ranking can surface false positives if the interaction data is incomplete. |\n| **Functional Enrichment (Digest)** | Turns any gene list into GO, KEGG, Reactome, or Reactome tables. | Adds biological meaning (pathways, processes). | Enrichment depends on annotation depth; some pathways may be over‑represented simply because they’re well‑studied. |\n| **Drug Overlay** | Adds links between proteins and FDA‑approved or investigational drugs. | Enables quick repurposing checks. | Only covers known drug‑target interactions; new drugs or unknown targets are invisible. |\n| **Omics Layer Overlay** | Visualizes expression, phosphorylation, or other quantitative data on the graph. | Connects raw data to functional context. | Requires you to supply the data; quality depends on your omics dataset. |\n| **Custom Network Upload** | Accepts any user‑supplied edge list (any species, pathway, or proprietary network). | Makes ChatDREx usable outside the default maps. | You’re responsible for the quality and format of your custom network. |\n| **Knowledge‑Graph (KG) Integration** | Pulls in NeDRex drug‑gene‑disease and pathway edges, clinical‑trial info, etc. | Bridges basic interaction data to translational endpoints. | The KG only contains links that have been curated; uncurated or novel associations won’t appear. |\n| **Literature Cards** | Quick access to PubMed titles, DOIs, “Read Papers” links. | Enables literature validation on the fly. | Only shows indexed papers; may miss very recent or non‑PubMed sources. |\n| **Graph‑level Exploration** | Interactive, zoomable network view with node cards and tooltips. | Facilitates hypothesis generation and visual storytelling. | Graph layout algorithms may obscure very dense regions; manual rearrangement can be time‑consuming. |\n| **Export & Share** | CSV, PNG/SVG, shareable links, project files. | Keeps results reproducible and shareable. | Exported images are static; dynamic features require a live project. |\n| **Project Management** | Save/Load projects, version control, sharing. | Enables reproducibility and teamwork. | Requires discipline to maintain consistent project settings. |\n| **Target Species** | Primarily human and mouse; other species maps are available. | Good for most biomedical studies. | Less comprehensive for rare species or non‑model organisms. |\n\n#### Bottom‑Line:  \n- **What it covers**: seed‑driven network expansion, ranking, enrichment, drug overlay, omics annotation, custom maps, knowledge‑graph linkage, and literature access.  \n- **Why that matters**: Provides a single, visual platform for turning a small gene list into a translational hypothesis.  \n- **Where it stops**: It works best with well‑curated protein interaction data; it can’t substitute for wet‑lab experiments, it’s limited to known interactions, and it’s strongest in human/mouse biology.  \n\nThat’s the full scope—everything you need to discover, interpret, and translate protein‑based hypotheses in one place.### The Scope of ChatDREx  \n*(In plain, “no‑code” language – what the tool can help you do and where it has limits.)*\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Seed‑Based Protein Discovery**\n- **Start with a handful of known genes** (3–10) and let the network “explore” around them.\n- **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** builds a tight, disease‑specific protein cluster.\n- **TrustRank** gives a genome‑wide ranking of relevance to those seeds.\n\n> **Why it matters** – turns a small, manually curated list into a visual, data‑driven module or candidate list.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Graph & Map Flexibility**\n- **Pre‑built maps**: Human PPI, Mouse PPI, PTM‑filtered, species‑specific, etc.\n- **Custom network upload**: Any edge list (CSV, GraphML, GML) to work on other organisms, pathways, or proprietary networks.\n\n> **Why it matters** – you can choose the exact interaction landscape that matches your biology.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Functional Annotation & Enrichment**\n- **Digest (Enrichment)**: GO, KEGG, Reactome, or pathway tables for any gene set.\n- **Omics overlays**: Color nodes by expression, phosphorylation, etc.\n\n> **Why it matters** – turns a raw protein list into biological themes and functional insights.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Translational Layer**\n- **Drug Overlay**: FDA‑approved or investigational drugs mapped onto proteins.\n- **Knowledge‑Graph Pull‑in**: NeDRex drug‑gene‑disease, pathway, and clinical‑trial links.\n- **Literature Cards**: Quick PubMed references on node click.\n\n> **Why it matters** – links basic biology to existing drugs, clinical data, and the literature.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Interactivity & Reproducibility**\n- **Graph view**: Zoom, pan, drag, click for node details.\n- **Tables panel**: Exportable gene lists, enrichment tables, ranking lists.\n- **Project save/load**: Preserve seeds, map choice, settings, and overlays in one file.\n- **Export options**: CSV, PNG/SVG, shareable project links.\n\n> **Why it matters** – makes results shareable, reproducible, and ready for publication.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Limitations & Boundaries**\n| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------------|--------|------------|\n| **Human‑centric focus** | Mostly built for human proteins; mouse maps exist but are less complete. | Use the mouse map if you’re working in a mouse model. |\n| **Interaction coverage** | Depends on the quality of public PPI data; rare or novel interactions may be missing. | Upload your own curated network if you have additional evidence. |\n| **Seed‑size sensitivity** | Very large seed lists (>20 genes) can produce huge, hard‑to‑interpret modules. | Keep seeds small (3‑10) for clarity; iterate if needed. |\n| **Drug overlay is limited to curated targets** | Novel or off‑target effects are not shown. | Combine with literature review to capture emerging drug‑gene links. |\n| **Omics overlays require user data** | The tool itself does not generate omics; you must supply the numbers. | Load your own expression, proteomics, or PTM data as needed. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom‑Line Summary  \nChatDREx is a **seed‑driven network analysis suite** that lets you:\n\n1. **Expand and rank protein modules** (DIAMOnD / TrustRank).  \n2. **Annotate them functionally** (Digest).  \n3. **Overlay translational layers** (drugs, omics, knowledge‑graph links).  \n4. **Explore literature** (node cards).  \n5. **Visualize, export, and share** everything in one reproducible project.\n\nIt’s powerful for human/mouse protein discovery, drug‑target identification, and hypothesis generation, but its accuracy is only as good as the interaction data and the seed genes you provide.",

  "answer" : "Below are **illustrative “what‑if” scenarios** you could design in ChatDREx – the same way a lab notebook lists planned experiments, but I’ll describe them so you never actually hit “Run” in the UI.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **DIAMOnD (Diamond) on a Parkinson’s seed list**\n\n| Step | What you’d put in | What you’d expect the graph to show |\n|------|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Seeds** | `LRRK2`, `SNCA`, `GBA` | The algorithm will expand around these three and create a compact cluster of ~20–25 proteins. |\n| **Map** | Human PPI (default) | The edges will be drawn from the most complete human interaction map. |\n| **Target size** | 20 iterations (≈25 nodes) | The module will include key hubs (e.g., `HSP90AA1`) and bridging proteins (e.g., `CHUK`). |\n| **Enrichment (Digest)** | Run on the module | You would see enriched terms like “mitochondrial organization”, “autophagy”, “lysosomal membrane”. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. **TrustRank on a breast‑cancer seed list**\n\n| Step | What you’d put in | What the ranking list might contain |\n|------|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Seeds** | `ERBB2`, `BRCA1`, `TP53` | These three well‑studied breast‑cancer genes. |\n| **Algorithm** | TrustRank | All ~20,000 human proteins would be scored by how tightly they interact with the seeds. |\n| **Top‑10 results** | Could include `AKT1`, `MAPK1`, `PIK3CA`, `MDM2` | These proteins are central in signaling pathways that drive breast‑cancer progression. |\n| **Overlay drugs** | Show drug‑target links on the graph | You’d instantly see which of the top hits are already druggable (e.g., `Trastuzumab` targets `ERBB2`). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Digest on a hypothetical “cardiac stress” gene set**\n\n| Input | What you’d supply | What the table would likely list |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Gene set | `BNIP3`, `CPT1B`, `SOD2`, `PINK1`, `TFAM` | 5 genes known to be involved in mitochondrial quality control. |\n| Enrichment | GO BP, KEGG, Reactome | Top terms: “mitochondrial inner membrane organization”, “autophagy‑mediated cell death”, “oxidative phosphorylation”. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Drug Overlay on a hypothetical Alzheimer’s module**\n\n| Step | What you’d do | What you’d see |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Seeds** | `APP`, `PSEN1`, `PSEN2` | Start with three core Alzheimer genes. |\n| **Map** | Human PPI | Standard interaction backdrop. |\n| **DIAMOnD** | 10 iterations | Build a module including `BACE1`, `TREM2`, `CLU`. |\n| **Drug overlay** | Add drug links | You’d see FDA‑approved drugs that target `BACE1` (e.g., “verubecestat” in trials). |\n| **Literature cards** | Click on `TREM2` | Quick PubMed citations about neuroinflammation. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Omics overlay on a cancer‑expression data set**\n\n| What you’d need | What the graph would reveal |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Expression values** (log‑fold change for tumor vs. normal) | Nodes in red would indicate up‑regulated proteins in tumors; blue nodes for down‑regulated. |\n| **Overlay onto a DIAMOnD module** | You could immediately spot which module members are over‑expressed in the cancer type you care about. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Knowledge‑Graph pull‑in for drug repurposing**\n\n| Seeds | Map | KG pull‑in | What you’d see |\n|-------|-----|------------|----------------|\n| `BRAF` | Human PPI | NeDRex drug‑gene‑disease edges | You’d get links to FDA‑approved `Vemurafenib`, clinical trials for melanoma, and additional disease associations (`NF1`). |\n\n---\n\n### How to Use These Examples in Your Planning\n\n1. **Draft a seed list** (e.g., 3–5 genes you’re convinced are important).  \n2. **Choose the default Human PPI map** (or a PTM‑filtered version if you’re looking at phosphorylation).  \n3. **Decide whether you want a local module (DIAMOnD) or a genome‑wide list (TrustRank).**  \n4. **Add an enrichment step (Digest)** to translate the raw list into pathways.  \n5. **Overlay a drug layer** if you want to see potential repurposing opportunities.  \n6. **Save the “project”** (without actually executing) so you can later run it on your machine.\n\nThese scenarios illustrate the kinds of analyses ChatDREx can support—seed‑driven module discovery, ranking, functional annotation, drug overlay, omics annotation, and literature integration—without ever hitting a “Run” button.",

  "question" : "What are the limitations?",
  "answer" : "### ChatDREx – Where It Stands Short\n\n| Limitation | What it means for you | Why it happens | Practical tip |\n|------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Human‑centric maps** | The built‑in protein‑protein interaction (PPI) graphs are mostly human (with a mouse version). | Most curated interaction databases are for human, and mouse data is less complete. | If you’re working in a rare species, upload your own custom network. |\n| **Data completeness** | Some proteins or interactions are missing or have low confidence. | Public PPI data is uneven: well‑studied proteins get many edges, obscure proteins get few. | Check the “degree” of your seeds; if they’re low‑degree, consider adding literature‑derived edges manually. |\n| **Seed size sensitivity** | Very large seed lists (10+ genes) can produce massive, noisy modules. | DIAMOnD (Diamond) builds a compact cluster; the more seeds you give it, the harder it is to keep the module readable. | Keep seeds to 3–5 genes for clear visual output; iterate with smaller subsets if you have many candidates. |\n| **Module size control** | You can set a target number of iterations, but the actual cluster size is a *guess*. | The algorithm will stop when the iteration count is reached, regardless of how many edges connect to the new nodes. | If you want a tighter cluster, limit iterations; if you want a broader view, increase them. |\n| **Edge confidence not weighted** | All edges are treated the same during module expansion and ranking. | The algorithm doesn’t differentiate “high‑confidence” vs. “low‑confidence” interactions. | Use a PTM‑filtered or high‑confidence map if you care about edge quality. |\n| **Drug overlay only shows curated targets** | Novel drug‑gene links (e.g., off‑target effects or newly discovered drugs) won’t appear. | The drug layer pulls from a curated database of known FDA‑approved or investigational targets. | Complement with an independent literature search to catch emerging drug‑gene associations. |\n| **Omics overlay requires your data** | ChatDREx doesn’t generate expression, phosphorylation, or other quantitative data for you. | The tool is a visualization / analysis engine, not an omics generator. | Prepare a CSV of your omics values and load it as an overlay when you’re ready. |\n| **No wet‑lab validation** | The tool can’t prove a protein actually causes a phenotype. | It’s purely computational – predictions need experimental confirmation. | Use ChatDREx to generate hypotheses; then design assays (Western blot, CRISPR, etc.) to test them. |\n| **Static output for exports** | PNG/SVG exports are snapshots; the interactive features are lost. | Exported images are images, not data files. | Keep the live project saved so collaborators can explore the dynamic graph on their own machine. |\n| **Limited real‑time collaboration** | Only a single user can interact with a live project at a time. | The web interface isn’t built for multi‑user real‑time editing. | Share the exported project file or the shareable link with teammates; they’ll load it on their own copy of ChatDREx. |\n| **No automated machine‑learning pipelines** | You can’t automatically train a deep‑learning model or do multi‑omics integration beyond overlays. | ChatDREx focuses on graph‑based seed expansion, ranking, enrichment, and translational links. | Pair ChatDREx outputs with other tools (GSEA, Cytoscape, R/Python scripts) for downstream machine‑learning work. |\n| **Knowledge‑Graph coverage is curated** | The NeDRex KG only contains edges that have been manually curated. | Novel or unpublished associations won’t show up. | Combine KG pull‑in with a PubMed search or your own pathway database to capture newer links. |\n| **Algorithmic assumptions** | DIAMOnD assumes tight module structure; TrustRank assumes seed‑based relevance propagates linearly. | These heuristics work well for many diseases but may miss non‑physical interactions (e.g., transcriptional co‑regulation). | If you suspect regulatory interactions, consider adding them to your custom network or using a different tool that models co‑expression. |\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom‑Line\n\n- **Data‑quality dependent**: The more curated your interaction and annotation data, the better the results.  \n- **Seed‑driven**: Wrong or too many seeds can skew the module or ranking.  \n- **Scope‑limited**: Primarily human/mouse PPI, drug‑target overlay, and enrichment – not a substitute for wet‑lab experiments or novel biology that isn’t in the public databases.\n\nUse the tips above to stay aware of these boundaries and to supplement ChatDREx with your own curated information when you need it.",

  "answer" : "## How to Get the Most Out of ChatDREx  \nThink of ChatDREx as a **network GPS**: you give it a few starting points (seeds) and it shows you the best roads, hidden stops, and the biggest traffic jams. Below is a practical play‑book to use the tool efficiently and get clear, actionable results.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Get Your Seeds Ready  \n| Step | What to do | Why it matters | Quick tip |\n|------|------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Pick 3–5 genes you’re *confident* about (e.g., disease core genes). | A small seed set keeps the map readable and the algorithm focused. | If you have >10 candidates, run ChatDREx on **sub‑sets** (3‑gene groups) and then merge the insights. |\n| Make sure the symbols match the database (HGNC for human). | A typo stops the seed from being recognized. | Use the auto‑complete drop‑down or copy the symbol exactly from a gene list. |\n| Save the seed list in a text file (optional). | You can copy‑paste the list later without re‑typing. | Useful if you plan to do multiple runs with the same seeds. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Pick the Right Map  \n| Map option | When to use it | How it changes the view |\n|------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Human PPI (default)** | Most general disease studies. | Most interactions, but includes low‑confidence edges. |\n| **Mouse PPI** | If you’re working with mouse models. | Fewer edges; useful for cross‑species validation. |\n| **PTM‑filtered** | You care about phosphorylation or ubiquitination. | Edges are limited to interactions supported by the specific PTM; the graph is sparser but more biologically specific. |\n| **Upload your own map** | Rare species, custom data, or a high‑confidence subset you curated. | Keeps the analysis tailored to your exact data. |\n\n> **Analogy**: Pick the map that matches the terrain of your experiment. A PTM‑filtered map is like a *high‑speed express lane*—fewer stops but faster travel.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Choose an Algorithm That Fits Your Question  \n| Algorithm | Typical question | How to set it up |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Diamond)** | “What’s the tight cluster around my seeds?” | Enter 3–5 seeds, choose *iterations* (e.g., 10 = ≈ 20–25 nodes). |\n| **TrustRank** | “Which proteins in the whole genome are most relevant to my seeds?” | Enter the same seeds, let the algorithm rank all ~20 000 proteins. |\n| **Both** | “First build a module, then rank all proteins inside it.” | Run Diamond → add a drug overlay → trust‑rank the whole view. |\n\n> **Tip**: If you’re new, start with *Diamond* for a clear cluster, then try *TrustRank* to see the genome‑wide picture.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Add Layers That Tell a Story  \n| Layer | What it does | How to use it |\n|-------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Enrichment (Digest)** | Highlights pathways/GO terms over‑represented in your genes. | Run after DIAMOnD or TrustRank; pick the default GO/KEGG/Reactome sets. |\n| **Drug Overlay** | Shows which proteins already have FDA‑approved or investigational drugs. | Tick the drug box; pill‑icons appear next to targets. |\n| **Literature Cards** | Quick PubMed hits for any node you click. | Useful for spotting recent findings or controversies. |\n| **Omics Overlay** (optional) | Load your own expression, phosphorylation, or mutation values. | Drag the CSV into the overlay panel; colors will reflect up‑ vs. down‑regulation. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Interact with the Graph Efficiently  \n| Feature | How it helps | What to do |\n|---------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Hover for metadata** | See degree, edge weight, PTM tags instantly. | Hover over a node to spot highly connected hubs. |\n| **Click a node for the card** | Quick literature snippet + UniProt info. | Double‑click the node to open the card. |\n| **Zoom & pan** | Keep the cluster readable. | Use the mouse wheel or pinch‑gesture; drag to reposition clusters. |\n| **Search bar (right panel)** | Jump directly to a gene you care about. | Type the symbol, press *Enter*, and the node will be highlighted. |\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Interpret the Results  \n| Result type | What to look for | Suggested next step |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| **Module summary table** | Size, central hubs, bridging proteins. | Highlight the top 5 hubs in a slide or manuscript. |\n| **Ranking table (TrustRank)** | High score proteins outside the module. | Prioritize them for CRISPR or over‑expression studies. |\n| **Enrichment table** | P‑values, gene counts, contributing genes. | Formulate a hypothesis (e.g., “mitophagy” drives your phenotype). |\n| **Drug table** | FDA status, trial phase. | If a drug exists, consider a drug‑gating experiment; if none, look for novel inhibitors. |\n\n> **Analogy**: The enrichment table is like a “cheat sheet” that tells you the common theme among your genes, while the ranking table is a “to‑do list” for follow‑up experiments.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Export & Share  \n| Export type | What you’ll get | Why it matters |\n|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **CSV / TSV** | Raw tables of nodes, edges, and annotations. | Easy to import into R, Python, or a spreadsheet for downstream stats. |\n| **PNG / SVG** | High‑resolution still of the current layout. | Ready for a PowerPoint slide or journal figure. |\n| **Project file** | Full interactive snapshot (seeds, map, overlays). | Keeps the analysis reproducible—others can reload exactly the same view. |\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Best‑Practice Checklist  \n\n1. **Start with a concise seed list** (3–5 genes).  \n2. **Choose a map that matches your biology** (PTM‑filtered if you care about phosphorylation).  \n3. **Run Diamond first** – it gives you a tight, interpretable cluster.  \n4. **Add TrustRank** if you want a broader candidate list.  \n5. **Apply Digest enrichment** to the gene set you’re most interested in (module or top‑N ranking).  \n6. **Overlay drugs & literature** to add translational context.  \n7. **Inspect the graph, read node cards, and adjust layout** for clarity.  \n8. **Export the tables you need** (gene list, enrichment, drug links) for downstream analysis or manuscript figures.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick “Daily Routine” Example  \n\n| Day | Task | Result |\n|-----|------|--------|\n| **Morning** | Upload a list of 4 Parkinson’s seeds, load the human PPI map. | Graph loads with seeds highlighted. |\n| **Mid‑day** | Run Diamond (20 iterations), view the 22‑node module. | Module summary pops up. |\n| **Afternoon** | Click TrustRank → see a genome‑wide list. | Top 10 hits include `AKT1`, `PIK3CA`. |\n| **Late afternoon** | Run Digest on the module. | Enrichment table shows “autophagy” and “mitochondrial membrane”. |\n| **Evening** | Export the project file and a PNG of the module. | Ready for the weekly lab meeting. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought  \nTreat ChatDREx as a **hypothesis‑generating assistant**:  \n- Give it clear, curated seeds.  \n- Let the algorithms explore the network.  \n- Use the visual and tabular summaries to craft a story.  \n- Share the exportable files so your collaborators can see exactly what you saw.\n\nWith these steps, you’ll transform a handful of genes into a full‑featured biological narrative—ready for the next experiment or manuscript.",

Define Your Research Question  \n- **What do you want to learn?**  \n  *Example:* “Which genes close to TP53 are likely involved in DNA‑repair pathways?”  \n- **Translate that into a list of *seed genes*** (usually 3–5).  \n\n> *Tip:* Keep the list short—fewer seeds mean a clearer module.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

  "answer" : "## Where to Go After You’ve Ran ChatDREx  \n\nYou’ve just finished a full run—seeds, network, algorithm, enrichment, and export. Now decide what to do next. Below is a quick decision tree to help you turn those outputs into real science.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Digest the Findings**  \n| Task | Why it matters | What to look for |\n|------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Read the module map** | Visual clues: hubs, bridges, isolated cliques | Are there proteins that connect two seed‑driven clusters? |\n| **Check the top enrichment terms** | Gives a biological theme | “DNA repair”, “apoptosis”, “immune‑response” |\n| **Look at drug hits** | Immediate translational angle | FDA‑approved drugs, investigational compounds |\n| **Browse literature cards** | Contextualize each node | Recent studies that mention the protein in your disease |\n\n> **Tip:** Highlight 2–3 proteins that appear repeatedly across layers. These are your “focus candidates”.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Refine Your Seeds (Optional)**  \n| Scenario | Action | Goal |\n|----------|--------|------|\n| You see a clear **linker protein** that connects two modules | Add it to the seed list and rerun | Validate whether it’s truly central |\n| You find **unexpected top‑ranked proteins** (TrustRank) | Expand your hypothesis | Maybe they’re “moon‑lighting” targets |\n| Enrichment terms don’t match your expectation | Re‑evaluate biological context | Maybe your seeds were too narrow or the map too dense |\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Plan Follow‑Up Experiments**  \n| Experiment type | Candidate proteins | Typical assay |\n|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Functional knock‑down/knock‑out** | Hubs or bridges | CRISPR‑Cas9, siRNA |\n| **Protein‑interaction validation** | Newly suggested linkers | Co‑IP, proximity ligation, yeast two‑hybrid |\n| **Pathway read‑outs** | Enriched pathways | Reporter assays, western blot for DNA‑repair markers |\n| **Drug‑screening** | Drug‑gable nodes | High‑throughput viability screen, dose‑response curves |\n\n> **Quick win:** Pick one protein that already has a drug; test the drug in your cell line to see if it modulates the pathway you care about.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Integrate Your Own Omics Data**  \n| Step | What to do | How it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| Load your expression/mutation/phospho CSV into the “Omics Overlay” | Match network nodes to your raw data | Are the candidate proteins up‑ or down‑regulated in your samples? |\n| Compare module genes vs. differential‑expression list | Prioritize the most disease‑specific genes | Filter out housekeeping hubs that are not dysregulated |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Collaborate & Share**  \n| Tool | Why it’s useful | How to do it |\n|------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Project file** | Keeps the entire interactive view reproducible | Send the `.drproj` file to a colleague |\n| **PNG/SVG** | Slide‑ready figure | Include in your next presentation or manuscript |\n| **CSV tables** | Downstream stats, heatmaps, or custom figure creation | Open in Excel/R/Python, plot a bar graph of top 10 proteins |\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Iterate**  \n| When to loop back | What to adjust | Goal |\n|-------------------|----------------|------|\n| After initial validation experiments | Seeds may change | Add new proteins that emerged as hits |\n| If enrichment terms are too broad | Use a PTM‑filtered map | Focus on signaling‑specific interactions |\n| If you want therapeutic angles | Add a drug overlay in a new run | Look for combinations with your hits |\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Ask for Feedback**  \n| Who to talk to | How to engage | What to get |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Lab mates** | “Can anyone confirm this interaction?” | Fresh perspective, maybe a hidden paper |\n| **Bioinformaticist** | “Can you run a permutation test?” | Confidence metrics, network statistics |\n| **Clinical partner** | “Could we repurpose this drug?” | Feasibility assessment, clinical trial design |\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Plan the Publication / Pitch**  \n| Section | Suggested content | Why it works |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Figure** | Export PNG/SVG of the module + drug overlay | Clear visual of the key players |\n| **Results** | Summarize top hubs, enrichment, drug hits | Show the story the network tells |\n| **Discussion** | Compare with literature cards | Highlight novelty or confirmation |\n\n> **Pro‑Tip:** Even if you’re not a bioinformatician, the tables can be copied into a Word document and annotated with a short paragraph about each protein’s role.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom‑Line Checklist  \n1. **Review** the module, enrichment, and drug hits.  \n2. **Select 2–3 priority proteins** for experimental validation.  \n3. **Design assays** (western blot, reporter, CRISPR).  \n4. **Run your own omics** (RNA‑seq, phospho‑proteomics) and overlay it next time.  \n5. **Iterate** with a refined seed list or a different map if needed.  \n6. **Share** the project file or PNG with collaborators and stakeholders.  \n\nThat’s the next chapter in your science story—use the outputs to ask a new question, test a hypothesis, or propose a therapeutic angle.

  "question" : "What happens if I make a mistake (how to recover)?",
  "answer" : "## If You Slip Up – How to Reset and Recover\n\nEveryone makes a typo or picks the wrong seed now and then. No worries—ChatDREx has a few “undo” tricks built in. Think of it like a photo‑editing program: you can revert to the last good snapshot, or start fresh without losing your entire project.\n\n| What went wrong | Quick Fix | Why it works |\n|-----------------|-----------|--------------|\n| **Wrong seed gene** | 1. Open the **Seeds panel**. <br>2. Remove the incorrect symbol. <br>3. Add the correct one. | The network graph updates instantly; the old seed never left a permanent trace. |\n| **Unwanted module expansion** (e.g., ran 200 iterations by accident) | 1. Click **“Back”** or **Undo** on the results page. <br>2. Or re‑run DIAMOnD with a smaller `k`. | The analysis history keeps a record of every run; you can jump back to the earlier result. |\n| **Wrong map selected** | 1. Go to **Network Settings**. <br>2. Switch to the correct map (Human PPI, PTM‑filtered, etc.). <br>3. Click **Reload**. | The map is a separate file; you can load any map without touching your seeds or results. |\n| **Accidental deletion of a result set** | 1. Open **Project History**. <br>2. Find the deleted run. <br>3. Click **Restore**. | The system archives every analysis run, so nothing is truly lost. |\n| **Mis‑typed gene symbol** | 1. The seed panel shows an *error icon* next to the bad entry. <br>2. Click the icon → **Edit** → type the correct symbol. <br>3. Save. | The network checks against the HGNC database; invalid symbols are flagged immediately. |\n| **Unwanted export format** | 1. Simply download the file again in the desired format (CSV, PNG, etc.). | Exports are stateless; you can re‑export without re‑running the analysis. |\n\n### Extra Safeguards\n\n- **Project File** – You can always **export** the entire project (`.drproj`). If you ever lose everything, just re‑import that file.\n- **Version History** – Every time you hit “Run”, a timestamped snapshot is stored. Use the *History* tab to jump back.\n- **Undo Button** – After a single change (like adding a seed), you can press the little **↩︎** button to revert it.\n\n### Quick Step‑by‑Step Recovery Example  \nSuppose you accidentally added `TPX3` instead of `TPX2` as a seed:\n\n1. **Open the Seeds list** – you'll see `TPX3` highlighted in red.  \n2. Click the **x** next to it or press **Delete**.  \n3. Type `TPX2` in the box, hit **Enter**.  \n4. Click **Run** again – the network will rebuild around the correct seed.\n\nThat’s it—no data lost, no extra runs required.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Mistakes are easy to undo.  \n- Every run is archived.  \n- Seeds, maps, and parameters are all editable on the fly.  \n\nFeel free to experiment—ChatDREx is designed to let you iterate quickly without the fear of permanent loss.

  "question" : "How do I reset or start over?",
  "answer" : "## Resetting or Starting Over in ChatDREx  \n\nThink of ChatDREx like a laboratory bench that you can clean and re‑set whenever you wish. Below are the “bench‑cleaning” steps you can use to:\n\n* **Clear the current workspace** (remove all seeds, graphs, and overlays).  \n* **Begin a brand‑new analysis** (choose a fresh map, new seeds, fresh algorithm).  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Quick “Undo” (One‑Step Back)**  \n| What you want | How to do it | Why it’s safe |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Remove the very last change you made (e.g., added a wrong seed or map) | Click the little **↩︎ (undo)** icon next to the change on the Results page or in the Seeds/Map panel. | The graph instantly reverts to the previous state—no data is deleted. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Clear the Current Analysis**  \n| Task | Step | Result |\n|------|------|--------|\n| **Erase all seeds** | 1. Open the **Seeds panel** (the list on the left). <br>2. Click the **x** next to each symbol or press **Delete**. | The map shows “no starting points” – the graph will no longer highlight any proteins. |\n| **Remove all overlays** | 1. In the **Overlay settings** (drug, literature, omics) un‑check every box. <br>2. Click **Apply**. | The map becomes plain PPI again. |\n| **Discard the current module/graph** | 1. Go to the **Results** tab. <br>2. Click the **“Reset”** button (the icon looks like a circular arrow). | The graph window clears; you’re left with the empty network. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Start a Brand‑New Project**  \n| Step | What you do | What you get |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Create a new project** | 1. Click **File → New Project** (or “+” icon). <br>2. Name it something like “TP53‑DNA‑repair”. | A fresh, empty workspace appears. |\n| **Choose a map** | 1. In the **Network Settings** pane, pick the map you want (Human PPI, PTM‑filtered, etc.). <br>2. Click **Load**. | The bench is now set with the right city map. |\n| **Add fresh seeds** | 1. Type your 3–5 gene symbols into the **Seeds** box. <br>2. Press **Enter** for each. | Seeds are now your new starting points. |\n| **Run a new analysis** | 1. Pick **DIAMOnD** or **TrustRank**. <br>2. Hit **Run**. | You’ve started from scratch—no old results, no carry‑over. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Resetting the Entire Workspace (All Settings + Results)**  \n| Action | How to Execute | What Happens |\n|--------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Reset All** | 1. Go to the **Project** menu at the top. <br>2. Select **“Reset Workspace”** (or “Clear All”). <br>3. Confirm the pop‑up. | All seeds, map selection, overlays, and previously run results are wiped; you’re back to a blank slate. |\n| **Discard Current Project File** | 1. Click **File → Close Project**. <br>2. Choose “Discard” if prompted. | The project file is deleted from the session (but you can still export a backup if you want). |\n\n> **Analogy:**  \n> *Resetting* = “Put your bench back to its default state.”  \n> *Starting over* = “Clean the bench, lay down a new map, and bring in a fresh set of chemicals (genes).”\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Optional Backup (Just in Case)**  \n| Why backup matters | How to do it | When you’ll use it |\n|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| You might want to keep a copy of the current state before clearing | **Export Project** (`.drproj`) | Import it later to jump back in time or share with a colleague. |\n| You want to preserve the exact seed list and map for future projects | **Save Seeds** to a text file | Re‑import into a new project whenever you wish. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick “Start‑Over” Checklist  \n1. **Clear seeds** → Seeds panel → Delete all entries.  \n2. **Reset overlays** → Overlay panel → Un‑check all boxes.  \n3. **Reload map** (if needed) → Network Settings → Load the desired map.  \n4. **Run** → Pick a new algorithm → Hit **Run**.  \n\nThat’s all—no lingering old data, no accidental deletions.  \n\nHappy resetting!",

  "answer" : "## Best‑Practice Guide for ChatDREx\n\nBelow is a “cheat‑sheet” that covers everything you need to keep your analysis clean, reproducible, and scientifically robust. Think of it as a lab protocol—follow it step by step, and you’ll avoid common pitfalls and get the most out of the system.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  **Define a Clear Research Question First**\n\n| What | Why it matters | Example |\n|------|----------------|---------|\n| **Goal statement** | Provides direction for seed selection and algorithm choice | “Identify novel drug‑target candidates for Parkinson’s disease that participate in mitochondrial dysfunction.” |\n| **Scope limits** | Avoids overwhelming the network with unrelated genes | Restrict to “genes implicated in mitochondrial biology” |\n| **Success metric** | Helps decide when you’re done | “Top 20 genes with >95 % enrichment in ‘mitochondrial transport’” |\n\n> **Tip:** Write the goal in a single sentence. This will guide every subsequent decision.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  **Choose the Right Biological Map**\n\n| Map option | When to use | Key differences |\n|------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Human PPI (full)** | General exploration, no bias | Largest network, many low‑confidence edges |\n| **PTM‑filtered** | You suspect post‑translational regulation | Fewer nodes, but edges are more biologically meaningful |\n| **Disease‑specific (e.g., Neurodegeneration)** | You have a curated sub‑network | Smaller, focused, faster to run |\n\n> **Best practice:** Start with the full PPI to get a global view, then narrow to a filtered map if the results look noisy.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  **Seed Selection – Quality Over Quantity**\n\n| Guideline | How to do it | Rationale |\n|-----------|--------------|------------|\n| **Select well‑validated genes** | Use curated sources (HGNC, OMIM, GWAS catalog) | Reduces noise from hypothetical proteins |\n| **Limit to 5–10 seeds** | Enter each gene in the Seeds panel | Too many seeds dilute module detection |\n| **Avoid duplicate or synonyms** | Check spelling against HGNC | Prevents accidental duplicate entries |\n| **Document your rationale** | Add a comment to each seed | Makes future replication easier |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  **Pick the Right Algorithm**\n\n| Algorithm | When it shines | What you’ll get |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Disease‑Module Expansion)** | You want a tight community around your seeds | Ordered list of “linker” proteins, module graph |\n| **TrustRank (Seed‑biased Ranking)** | You need a global ranking of candidates | Score for every protein in the network |\n| **Combination** | Run DIAMOnD first, then filter TrustRank scores | Best of both worlds |\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** Use DIAMOnD for module discovery; use TrustRank when you suspect the target genes may lie a few steps away from your seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  **Functional Enrichment (Digest) – The “So What?” Step**\n\n| What to choose | Why | How to interpret |\n|----------------|-----|------------------|\n| **GO (Biological Process)** | Broad functional categories | Identify key processes enriched in your module |\n| **KEGG pathways** | Pathway‑centric view | Detect specific signaling or metabolic routes |\n| **Disease Ontology** | Direct disease relevance | Validate that your module touches the disease of interest |\n\n> **Remember:** A p‑value < 0.05 (after FDR correction) is a strong signal, but context matters. Look at the effect size (enrichment score) too.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  **Overlay and Visual Inspection**\n\n| Overlay | Best use | Visual cue |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| **Drug hits** | Identify druggable nodes | Colored nodes with drug icons |\n| **Literature cards** | Quick literature check | Hover for paper titles |\n| **Omics data** | Correlate expression/mutation | Heatmap on node edges |\n\n> **Best practice:** Keep overlays modular—turn them on/off as needed to avoid visual clutter.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  **Documentation & Reproducibility**\n\n| What to record | How | Why it matters |\n|----------------|-----|-----------------|\n| **Project name & date** | In the project file header | Easy to locate later |\n| **Seed list & justification** | In the Seeds panel comments | Future reviewers can trace your choices |\n| **Map version** | Note in the settings panel | Different map releases may give different results |\n| **Algorithm parameters** | Record the `k` value, damping factor, etc. | Allows exact replication |\n| **Enrichment settings** | Keep a copy of the selected ontologies | Helps cross‑check with other tools |\n| **Exported files & formats** | Export CSV/PNG/SVG | Ready for publication or downstream analysis |\n\n> **Use the built‑in “Export Project”** (`.drproj`) to save a single file that contains **all** the information above. That file can be re‑imported anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### 8.  **Iteration Strategy**\n\n1. **Run initial DIAMOnD → Inspect module**  \n2. **If the module is too large or too small, adjust `k`.**  \n3. **Filter by TrustRank or overlay drugs**  \n4. **Validate top hits experimentally**  \n5. **Add newly validated proteins to the seed list**  \n6. **Repeat**  \n\n> **Key point:** Keep the iterations incremental. Each run should be a logical next step from the previous one, not a random “try‑and‑see” spree.\n\n---\n\n### 8.  **Error Management – Quick Recovery**\n\n| Common mistake | Quick fix | What to keep |\n|----------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Wrong gene symbol | Click the error icon → Edit → correct | No data lost |\n| Over‑expanded module | Undo → or rerun DIAMOnD with smaller `k` | Keeps the seed list intact |\n| Wrong map loaded | Reload the correct map | Seeds remain unchanged |\n| Accidental deletion of a run | Project History → Restore | Never loses a result |\n\n> **Pro tip:** Use the **“Reset Workspace”** sparingly—usually you only need to clear overlays or a small set of seeds.\n\n---\n\n## Quick‑Start Workflow (Checklist)\n\n1. **Write Goal** → Capture success metric.  \n2. **Select Map** → Load (Human PPI → PTM‑filtered if needed).  \n3. **Add 5–10 well‑validated seeds** → Document each.  \n4. **Run DIAMOnD** (`k` = 50–100).  \n5. **Run Digest** → GO + KEGG.  \n6. **Add Drug & Literature overlays** as needed.  \n7. **Export**: PNG for figures, CSV for tables, `.drproj` for full backup.  \n\nRepeat the workflow when you tweak seeds or parameters—each run is a separate “experiment” that can be archived and compared.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\n**Keep it tidy, keep it documented, keep it iterative.**  \nWhen you treat your ChatDREx workspace like a well‑maintained lab bench—clean after each experiment, label everything, and save backups—you’ll get reliable, reproducible insights that stand up to peer review and accelerate your discovery pipeline.",

  "answer" : "## How Other Researchers and Teams Use ChatDREx\n\nBelow are a handful of real‑world “recipes” that people have adopted in their labs, clinics, or drug‑development pipelines. Each example shows *what they started with*, *which features they turned on*, and *the outcome* that was published, shared, or accelerated.\n\n| # | Field | Starting Point | What They Ran | Why It Worked | Typical Output |\n|---|-------|----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1 | **Academic biology** | A short list of genes from a CRISPR screen (e.g., 12 candidates) | 1. **DIAMOnD** (k = 30)  <br> 2. **Digest** (GO & KEGG)  <br> 3. Literature overlay | The screen hits are the *seeds*; DIAMOnD finds a disease‑relevant module and points out “linker” hubs that were missed by the screen.  <br> Digest confirms that the module is enriched for “cell‑cycle regulation.” | A 2‑panel figure (module + enrichment table) for a paper on tumor‑suppression pathways. |\n| 2 | **Pharma R&D** | Known drug targets for a rare disease (e.g., SLC6A1 in epilepsy) | 1. **TrustRank** (damping = 0.85)  <br> 2. Drug overlay (FDA, IND, experimental)  <br> 3. Literature overlay | TrustRank ranks all proteins by proximity to the target, revealing “near‑by” proteins that could be repurposed drugs.  <br> The drug overlay shows existing small‑molecule ligands. | A prioritized list of 15 new targetable proteins, plus a network image that is used in the internal drug‑scoring deck. |\n| 3 | **Clinical genomics** | Exome‑derived variant list (≈ 200 genes) | 1. **TrustRank** (k = 200)  <br> 2. Overlay **mutation frequency** (from TCGA)  <br> 3. Export high‑ranked genes | The ranking surface gives a quick, reproducible way to sift through hundreds of variants and focus on the most disease‑like ones.  | A CSV of the top 20 genes, ready to be sent to a clinical trial design team. |\n| 4 | **Systems‑biology course** | Seed: “TP53, BRCA1” (classic cancer genes) | 1. Run **DIAMOnD** and **TrustRank** side‑by‑side  <br> 2. Overlay literature cards  <br> 3. Export network images | The visual comparison shows how module‑based vs. ranking‑based views differ.  | Slide‑ready PNGs and a short video tutorial that was used in a graduate‑level class. |\n| 5 | **Personalized oncology** | Patient’s tumor RNA‑seq profile (≈ 5000 genes) | 1. Import omics overlay (expression heatmap)  <br> 2. Add high‑expression genes as seeds  <br> 3. Run **TrustRank**  <br> 4. Overlay **mutation density** | Integrating expression with network proximity highlights over‑expressed, mutated hubs that are plausible therapeutic targets. | A heat‑mapped network that was included in a case‑study presentation at a tumor board. |\n| 6 | **Translational medicine** | Candidate genes from a GWAS of cardiovascular disease | 1. **DIAMOnD** (k = 50)  <br> 2. Overlay “Drug hits” (approved + investigational)  <br> 3. Literature overlay | The module highlights proteins that already have drug‑like molecules, making repurposing proposals realistic. | A manuscript‑ready figure linking GWAS loci to a druggable module. |\n| 7 | **Public‑health policy** | List of essential proteins for *in vitro* vaccine response | 1. **TrustRank** (damping = 0.7)  <br> 2. Overlay “Literature cards”  <br> 3. Export top 100 | Ranking across the map gives a ranked list of proteins that can be evaluated as biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. | A downloadable table of candidate biomarkers used in a policy briefing. |\n\n---\n\n### How They Turned the Process Into a Routine\n\n1. **Save a “Template”**  \n   *Many teams create a “starter project” (a `.drproj` file) that includes the map, default parameters, and the overlays they always use. Once saved, the next time they start a new screen or dataset they simply open the template and change the seed list.*\n\n2. **Automate with Keyboard Shortcuts**  \n   *Pharma teams use `Ctrl+S` to keep a version‑controlled project, `Ctrl+R` to reset between different diseases, and `Ctrl+Shift+E` to dump ready‑to‑publish network images.*\n\n3. **Share a Whole Project**  \n   *Because a `.drproj` file bundles every setting, collaborators—no matter where they are—can open the same project, tweak a parameter, and instantly see the difference. This makes cross‑institution meetings and peer‑reviewing a breeze.*\n\n4. **Export to Supplementary Materials**  \n   *Researchers often export the enrichment table as CSV and the network as SVG so they can embed high‑resolution figures in their PDF manuscripts or online data portals.*\n\n5. **Combine with Other Tools**  \n   *Some groups feed ChatDREx outputs into downstream systems biology suites (e.g., Cytoscape, R/Shiny dashboards) or use the gene lists in pathway‑engineering pipelines.*\n\n---\n\n## Take‑away\n\n- **Academia**: Turn short‑lists from screens or screens into modules and functional hypotheses.  \n- **Pharma/BIOSCIENCE**: Prioritize druggable nodes and assess existing compounds.  \n- **Clinical genomics**: Rank variants, integrate omics, and flag high‑risk genes.  \n- **Teaching**: Export network snapshots as slide‑ready visuals.  \n\nIn all cases, the common pattern is: *Start with a question or seed list, let ChatDREx load the map, run DIAMOnD or TrustRank, interpret with Digest and overlays, and export results that are ready for publication or collaboration.*",

Below are the most‑used “knives” and how you pick the right one for a given research question.)*\n\n| # | Task | What It Means | Why It’s Useful |\n|---|------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **1** | **Seed‑based Module Expansion** (DIAMOnD) | Start with a handful of known genes and let the algorithm grow a tightly‑connected “community” around them. | Reveals *linker* proteins you’d miss if you only looked at direct neighbors. |\n| **2** | **Whole‑Network Ranking** (TrustRank) | Rank every protein in the map by how strongly it’s connected to your seeds. | Gives a global “priority list” that can be turned into drug‑target ideas or hypothesis‑testing. |\n| **3** | **Functional Enrichment** (Digest) | Take any gene list (module, ranking top‑N, or your own data) and test for over‑represented GO terms or pathways. | Turns a raw list into biological insight—e.g., “most genes are involved in synaptic transmission.” |\n| **4** | **Literature Overlay** | Attach recent abstracts, PubMed IDs, or review summaries to each node. | Lets you see whether a protein is already well‑studied or a novel candidate. |\n| **5** | **Drug Overlay** | Add FDA‑approved, investigational, or pre‑clinical drug data to the map. | Quickly spots “druggable” nodes and existing therapeutics that could be repurposed. |\n| **6** | **Omics Integration** | Map your own RNA‑seq, proteomics, or mutation data onto the network (heat‑maps, color coding). | Allows you to see whether a gene is over‑expressed, mutated, or otherwise altered in your samples. |\n| **7** | **Network Visualization** | Generate publication‑ready PNG/SVG images of modules, rankings, or full maps. | Saves hours of manual drawing and guarantees that figures are reproducible. |\n| **8** | **Project Saving & Sharing** | Bundle all seeds, parameters, overlays, and images into a single “project file.” | Anyone who opens the file can reproduce the exact same analysis without re‑parsing data. |\n| **8** | **Parameter Tweaking & Re‑analysis** | Adjust `k` for DIAMOnD, change damping for TrustRank, or refine overlays. | You can iterate quickly—e.g., “What happens if we look for 50 instead of 30 linker proteins?” |\n| **8** | **Comparative Module Analysis** | Overlay two or more modules side‑by‑side and compute similarity (Jaccard, edge overlap). | Handy for cross‑species studies or comparing disease A vs. disease B. |\n| **9** | **Filtering by Evidence** | Keep only nodes that meet certain criteria (expression threshold, literature hits, druggable score). | Cuts noise so you can focus on the most promising subset. |\n| **10**| **Export & Import** | CSV tables, image files, or the whole project ZIP. | Makes it easy to include data in a manuscript, slide deck, or share with collaborators. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “How‑to” for a Few Typical Workflows\n\n| Workflow | Typical Input | Typical Output |\n|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| **CRISPR‑screen follow‑up** | 10‑12 candidate genes | DIAMOnD module + enrichment table + literature overlay |\n| **Drug‑target prioritization** | 3 disease genes | TrustRank top‑50 + drug overlay + literature cards |\n| **Patient‑specific omics** | RNA‑seq of 2000 DE genes | Heat‑map overlay + TrustRank ranking + enriched pathways |\n| **Teaching a class** | Classic cancer genes (TP53, BRCA1) | DIAMOnD vs. TrustRank visual comparison + simple enrichment summary |\n| **Grant proposal** | GWAS hits for a rare disease | DIAMOnD module + drug overlay + enrichment + PDF‑ready images |\n\n---\n\n## How to Think About the Right Task  \n\n1. **Identify the question**  \n   - *Is it a “module” (focus on a local community) or a “ranking” (look at the whole map)?*  \n   - *Do you need to interpret a list with biology (enrichment)?*  \n\n2. **Choose the algorithm**  \n   - **DIAMOnD** → “grow a neighborhood”  \n   - **TrustRank** → “score everything”  \n\n3. **Add context**  \n   - Overlay literature and drug data to give the nodes meaning.  \n\n4. **Validate biologically**  \n   - Run enrichment or overlay omics data to see if the network picture matches what you see in the lab.  \n\n5. **Export**  \n   - Save a neat image or a CSV table for your paper, slides, or shared project.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom‑Line  \nThese 10 tasks cover almost every analysis you’ll want to run in a network‑medicine setting: from expanding a small seed set to turning a whole list of candidate targets into a drug‑repurposing strategy. Pick the knife that matches your question, add the overlays that give you confidence, and you’re ready to write a convincing story—or design a new therapy.",

The Core “Ingredient” Layer  \n\n| What you set | Where it lives | How to change it |\n|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Seed genes** (the starting point) | Project “Seeds” tab | Type, paste, or upload a list of gene symbols or Ensembl IDs |\n| **Network source** | Project “Network” tab | Pick from the built‑in PPI map (Human, Mouse, etc.) or load your own .edgelist file |\n| **Species & background** | Project “General” tab | Set the organism (Human, Mouse, etc.) – this drives which genes are available and which annotation databases are used |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Algorithm “Spice” Settings  \n\n| Algorithm | Key knob(s) | Typical range | What the knob does |\n|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| **DIAMOnD (Module Expansion)** | `k` – target module size | 10–200 | Number of nodes the module will grow to. 10 = tight, 200 = broader |\n| | `degree filter` – minimum node degree | 1–10 | Excludes very low‑degree proteins that are often noisy |\n| | `score threshold` – statistical cutoff | 0.01–0.1 | Only add nodes whose connection to the current module is highly significant |\n| **TrustRank (Ranking)** | `alpha` – damping factor | 0.5–0.9 | How fast “trust” decays as you move away from seeds |\n| | `max iterations` | 100–1000 | Stops the iterative calculation once scores stabilize |\n| | `personalization` – seed weight | 0.1–1.0 | Gives stronger “trust” to certain seeds |\n| **Enrichment (Digest)** | `library` | GO BP / GO MF / KEGG / Reactome | Which biological knowledge base to test against |\n| | `background set` | All genes in network / All human genes | Controls the statistical baseline |\n| | `multiple testing correction` | FDR / Bonferroni | How strict you want the significance threshold |\n\n*Tip:* In the UI, each algorithm has a small “⚙️” icon. Click it, and you’ll see sliders or drop‑downs for the knobs above.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Overlay “Toppings”  \n\n| Overlay | What it adds | How to enable |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Literature Cards** | Recent papers, PubMed IDs, abstracts | Turn on “Literature” in the “Overlays” panel |\n| **Drug Cards** | FDA‑approved, investigational drugs, targets | Toggle “Drug” overlay and choose the drug database (DrugBank, ChEMBL, etc.) |\n| **Omics Heat‑map** | Expression, mutation, copy‑number values | Upload your own CSV (gene × sample) and select “Heat‑map” overlay |\n| **Evidence Filters** | Keep only nodes with a minimum number of supporting literature hits or druggability score | Set thresholds in the “Filters” section |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Visual & Output Preferences  \n\n| Setting | Why it matters | Where to adjust |\n|---------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Color scheme** | Choose a palette that fits your journal or slide deck | “View > Color Theme” |\n| **Edge weight display** | Show or hide interaction confidence scores | “Show Edge Weights” checkbox |\n| **Figure layout** | Automatic layout, force‑directed, circular | “Layout” button in the network panel |\n| **Export format** | PNG / SVG / PDF for images, CSV for tables | In the “Export” menu, pick the desired file type |\n| **Report style** | Markdown‑only, Markdown + images, PDF | “Report” button → select “Full / Summary” view |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Saving & Sharing the Configuration  \n\n1. **Project file (`.drproj`)**  \n   - Contains *all* the settings above plus overlays and images.  \n   - Share it with a collaborator; they can open it and see exactly what you ran.\n\n2. **JSON config snippet**  \n   - Advanced users can export the knobs as a short JSON block (just copy the “Export → Config JSON”).  \n   - You can paste this JSON into a new project to re‑apply the exact same settings.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Example: Tweaking a Typical Run  \n\n| Step | What you do | Resulting flavor |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| 1 | **Seeds** – APP, PSEN1, APOE | 3 core Alzheimer genes |\n| 2 | **Network** – Human PPI (2024) | All human protein interactions |\n| 3 | **DIAMOnD** – `k = 40`, `degree filter = 3` | A 40‑node module that includes 3 linker hubs |\n| 4 | **TrustRank** – `alpha = 0.8` | Very focused ranking, trust decays slowly |\n| 5 | **Enrichment** – GO BP, FDR = 0.05 | Highlights synaptic pathways |\n| 6 | **Overlays** – Literature & Drug cards | Each node now shows recent papers and available drugs |\n\nWhen you click **Run**, ChatDREx immediately recalculates with those knobs and shows the new module, ranking, and enrichment tables.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom‑Line\n\n- **Everything is exposed** in a simple tab‑based UI—no scripting required.  \n- **Algorithms**: tweak `k`, `alpha`, libraries, etc., with sliders or drop‑downs.  \n- **Overlays**: turn on literature, drugs, or your own omics heat‑map with a single click.  \n- **Export**: images, CSVs, or the full project file are all ready for publication or collaboration.\n\nFeel free to mix and match—your next analysis is only a few clicks away.",

  "question" : "How long do analyses typically take?",
  "answer" : "## Typical Running Times – What to Expect\n\n| Analysis | Rough Time (on a typical research workstation) | What Influences the Duration |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Network Load (FETCH_NETWORK)** | < 10 s | Size of the PPI map (Human ~15 k nodes / 100 k edges) and disk‑speed |\n| **DIAMOnD Module Expansion** | 5–30 s | <br>• Target size `k` (e.g., 20‑100 nodes)<br>• Density of the local network (highly connected = slower) |\n| **TrustRank Ranking** | 10–40 s | • Damping factor & max iterations<br>• Size of the full network (larger networks → more steps) |\n| **Enrichment / Digest** | 3–15 s | • Size of gene list (small lists = faster)<br>• Number of libraries searched (GO + KEGG vs. GO only) |\n| **Literature / Drug Overlay** | 5–15 s | • How many nodes receive full citation / drug records (bulk DB look‑ups) |\n| **Omics Heat‑map Overlay** | 5–20 s | • Size of the uploaded omics file (tens vs. hundreds of samples) |\n| **Visualization / Image Export** | 2–10 s | • Layout algorithm (force‑directed can take longer on dense maps) |\n| **Whole Project Save / Share** | 2–8 s | Simple file I/O – negligible compared to the calculations |\n\n---\n\n### Why the Numbers Vary  \n\n1. **Network Size**  \n   - Human PPI (~15 k nodes) is the “standard.” If you bring in a custom map with 200 k nodes, the runtime roughly doubles.  \n\n2. **Algorithm Parameters**  \n   - **DIAMOnD**: A module of 200 nodes (`k = 200`) will take ~3× longer than a 30‑node module.  \n   - **TrustRank**: A high damping (`α ≈ 0.9`) and many iterations (`> 800`) add a few seconds, but the effect on biology is usually minimal.  \n\n3. **Hardware**  \n   - 4–8 CPU cores and SSD storage keep everything in the 10‑30 second ballpark.  \n   - On a slower laptop or a shared cluster node, expect 1–2× the times above.  \n\n4. **I/O and Overlays**  \n   - If you turn on the full literature overlay, the system fetches PubMed IDs from the server (adds ~5 s).  \n   - Drug or omics overlays are lightweight; they are essentially “painting” over the already‑built graph.  \n\n---\n\n### A Typical End‑to‑End Workflow\n\n1. **Load Network** – 7 s  \n2. **Run DIAMOnD (k = 40)** – 12 s  \n3. **Run TrustRank (α = 0.8)** – 22 s  \n4. **Digest (GO + KEGG)** – 9 s  \n5. **Add Overlays & Export Images** – 8 s  \n\n**Total** ≈ **58 seconds** on a modern 4‑core workstation.  \n\n---\n\n## “Cheat Sheet” for Planning\n\n- **Small jobs** (modules ≤ 50 nodes) finish in **< 30 seconds**.  \n- **Full‑network rankings** usually finish within **< 45 seconds**.  \n- **Large custom networks** (200 k+ edges) may push to **1–2 minutes**, but still very fast compared to manual curation.  \n\nIf you see a spike in time (e.g., > 2 minutes), it’s usually because:\n- You set a very high `k` or `max iterations`.  \n- You are using a custom network that is an order of magnitude larger than the default.  \n- Your machine’s SSD is under heavy load from other tasks.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** ChatDREx is designed to be *instant*. Even a full‑project analysis rarely takes more than a minute, giving you rapid feedback and letting you iterate quickly.",

  "answer" : "## What You Need to Feed into ChatDREx  \n\nThink of ChatDREx as a cooking pot: you put in a few key ingredients, and it spices them up with network‑science magic. Here’s the plain‑English “shopping list” you’ll need:\n\n| **Input Type** | **What it Looks Like** | **How to Provide It** | **Why It Matters** |\n|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Seed Genes / Proteins** | Gene symbols (`TP53`), Ensembl IDs (`ENSG00000141510`), or a list of any identifiers that match the chosen network | • Paste into the “Seeds” box <br>• Upload a simple text/CSV file (one gene per line) <br>• Or copy‑paste from a spreadsheet | These are the “starting points” that tell ChatDREx which part of the map to explore. |\n| **Species / Background** | Human (`Homo sapiens`), Mouse (`Mus musculus`), etc. | Set once in the “General” tab (default is Human). | Keeps identifiers and annotation databases in sync with the network you’re using. |\n| **Network Map (optional)** | An edgelist file: two columns (`nodeA,nodeB`) that lists all interactions in the map (or a built‑in Human PPI map that ships with ChatDREx) | • Choose “Custom Network” and browse to the file <br>• Or click “Load Default” to use the pre‑bundled Human PPI | If you have a curated or species‑specific map, you can plug it in; otherwise the built‑in Human PPI is usually all you need. |\n| **Omics Overlay (optional)** | A table of expression, mutation, or copy‑number values: rows = genes, columns = samples/conditions | • Upload a CSV (`gene, sample1, sample2, …`) <br>• The first column must be gene identifiers that match your seeds/network | Lets the graph show a heat‑map of “high‑expression” or “mutated” genes right on the map. |\n| **Custom Parameter Settings (optional)** | Just a handful of numbers or choices (e.g., `k = 40` for DIAMOnD, `alpha = 0.8` for TrustRank) | • Use the sliders/toggles in the UI <br>• Or paste a short JSON block exported from a previous run | Fine‑tunes how aggressively ChatDREx grows modules or scores the whole network. |\n| **Overlay Data (optional)** | Bibliographic IDs (PMIDs), drug IDs (DrugBank IDs), or your own evidence scores | • Turn on “Literature” or “Drug” overlay in the overlays panel <br>• For your own evidence, upload a CSV with `gene, score` columns | Adds real‑world context—papers, drugs, or any evidence you care about. |\n\n### Quick Tips for Getting It Right\n\n1. **Keep the identifiers consistent** – if you choose the Human PPI map, use HGNC symbols or Ensembl IDs that the map recognizes.  \n2. **One gene per line** is the simplest format; no commas, no fancy formatting.  \n3. **If you’re unsure** about an identifier, paste it into the “Validate” button next to the Seeds box—ChatDREx will check it against the network and flag any mismatches.  \n4. **Use the defaults** for everything else if you’re just trying the tool out; the UI will auto‑fill the right species, background, and libraries for you.\n\nOnce you drop in these inputs, ChatDREx takes over, pulls the relevant nodes from the network, runs the algorithms, and gives you back modules, rankings, heat‑maps, and enriched biology—all in the same interactive session.

Every button or overlay is a separate tool, and you can keep any combination of them active at the same time. Below is a quick recipe for a multi‑feature workflow that most users find useful.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Load Your Seed(s) and Network  \n- **Seeds**: Add `TP53`, `BRCA1`, `MDM2` (one per line or comma‑separated).  \n- **Network**: Keep the default Human PPI (or upload a custom edgelist).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Run the Core Algorithms (in parallel)\n\n| What to do | Why it’s useful | How to do it |\n|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **DIAMOnD** (module expansion) | Finds a tightly‑connected cluster around your seeds. | Click **DIAMOnD** → set `k = 40` → **Run** |\n| **TrustRank** (global ranking) | Gives a ranked list of all genes based on “trust” propagation. | Click **TrustRank** → set `α = 0.8` → **Run** |\n\nBoth results appear side‑by‑side in the workspace. You can now see **both** the module and the global ranking simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Add Contextual Overlays\n\n| Overlay | What it shows | How to add |\n|---------|---------------|------------|\n| **Literature** | Number of PubMed papers mentioning each gene. | Toggle **Literature** in the Overlays panel. |\n| **DrugBank** | Known drugs that target each gene. | Toggle **DrugBank**. |\n| **Expression Heat‑map** | Your own expression or mutation data (optional). | Upload a CSV (`gene, sample1, sample2, …`) in the **Expression** tab. |\n\nThese overlays are **dynamic**—they’ll appear on *any* node you hover over, no matter which algorithm produced the node.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Perform Functional Enrichment (Digest)\n\n| What to do | Why it’s useful | How to do it |\n|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Run **Digest** on the DIAMOnD module | Confirms that the module is biologically meaningful (e.g., enriched in “DNA repair”). | Click **Digest** → select **GO BP** and **KEGG** → **Run** |\n| Run **Digest** on the top 50 TrustRank genes | Finds pathways enriched among the highest‑ranked candidates. | In the TrustRank table, select top 50 → click **Digest** |\n\nBoth enrichment tables appear in the workspace; you can compare which biological themes appear in the module vs. the global ranking.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Export a Combined Report\n\n1. **Select “Export → Report”**.  \n2. Choose **PNG + Tables + Enrichment**.  \n3. The resulting PDF/HTML contains:  \n   * The visual network with overlays.  \n   * The DIAMOnD module (highlighted).  \n   * The TrustRank ranking list.  \n   * Both enrichment tables.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips for Combining Features\n\n- **Layer the overlays**: You can toggle on/off any overlay without affecting the algorithm outputs.  \n- **Save intermediate states**: Click **Save Session** after each step; you can reload it later.  \n- **Adjust parameters on the fly**: Change `k` or `α` and re‑run; the network updates instantly.  \n- **Use the “Compare” view**: Some UI versions let you place two network views side‑by‑side (e.g., module vs. global ranking) for side‑by‑side inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nAll the features are *independent* and *combinable*. Just activate the ones you need, and ChatDREx will layer them together for you.

  "answer" : "## Quick‑Start Guide: Getting the Most Out of ChatDREx  \n\nBelow is a short “cheat sheet” you can keep on hand (or print out) to help you extract the maximum insight from every run.\n\n| Goal | What to Do | Why It Helps | Tips |\n|------|------------|--------------|------|\n| **Start fast** | Open the web app and type your seed genes into the **Seeds** box. | The seed list is the *anchor* of every analysis. | Make sure the symbols are correct (use HGNC symbols). |\n| **Choose the right algorithm** | • **DIAMOnD** – when you want a tight, disease‑specific module.  <br>• **TrustRank** – when you want a global ranking of all candidates. | Each algorithm looks at the network differently. | Try both on the same seeds and compare results. |\n| **Use overlays** | Turn on **Literature**, **DrugBank**, or **Expression** overlays. | Adds immediate context (papers, drugs, expression levels). | Toggle layers on/off to keep the view uncluttered. |\n| **Check statistical significance** | Run **Digest** (GO/KEGG) on the module or ranked list. | Confirms that the genes belong to real biological pathways, not random noise. | Focus on the top 10–15 enriched terms; they’re the most interpretable. |\n| **Iterate on parameters** | Adjust `k` (module size) in DIAMOnD or `α` (damping) in TrustRank. | Small changes can reveal new key players or remove noisy ones. | Keep a simple log of the settings you used for reproducibility. |\n| **Save sessions** | Click **Save Session** after each major step. | Lets you return later or share the exact same analysis with a collaborator. | Name the session after the project or question (e.g., “Alzheimer_TP53”). |\n| **Export comprehensively** | Use **Export → Report** to get PNG, tables, and enrichment results together. | One file is enough for presentations, publications, or future reference. | Check the exported file for formatting issues before sending it out. |\n| **Explore the community** | Visit the forum or watch a webinar if you hit a snag. | Others often have the same question; you can learn shortcuts. | Bookmark the FAQ section; it covers the most common “gotchas.” |\n\n---\n\n### A Mini‑Roadmap for a Typical Project\n\n1. **Define the question** (e.g., “Which genes link TP53 to Alzheimer’s?”).  \n2. **Input seeds** (TP53, APP, PSEN1).  \n3. **Run DIAMOnD** to find the core module.  \n4. **Run TrustRank** to surface additional candidates.  \n5. **Add literature overlay** to see which genes are well‑studied.  \n6. **Run Digest** on both the module and the top 50 ranked genes.  \n7. **Save session & export report**.  \n8. **Interpret**: Look for overlapping enriched pathways, drug targets, or novel candidates.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nChatDREx is like a Swiss‑army knife: each feature is a tool you can pull out as needed. The trick is to start simple, layer on context, and iterate on parameters. With these steps and the quick‑start guide, you’ll be turning raw gene lists into clear biological stories in no time.

You can use one or many of them on the same set of seeds, or you can use them on different seed sets, and you can chain them together to get richer results.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Parallel Analyses on the Same Seeds**\n\n| Analysis | What it gives you | How to set it up |\n|----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **DIAMOnD** | A tightly‑connected disease module. | Click *DIAMOnD* → set `k` → *Run*. |\n| **TrustRank** | A global ranking of every gene relative to the seeds. | Click *TrustRank* → set `α` → *Run*. |\n| **Digest** (on DIAMOnD module) | Functional themes of the module. | In the module view, click *Digest*. |\n| **Digest** (on top‑ranked TrustRank genes) | Functional themes of the high‑trust candidates. | Select top N genes → *Digest*. |\n\nYou can keep all four results visible side‑by‑side. The visual interface lets you toggle each panel on or off, so you can compare them without clutter.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sequential Analyses (Chain of Operations)**\n\n1. **Seed → DIAMOnD** → get module.  \n2. **Module → Digest** → identify enriched pathways.  \n3. **Seed → TrustRank** → get ranked list.  \n4. **Top N TrustRank → Digest** → see what pathways those high‑rank genes belong to.  \n5. **Overlay** drug or literature data on any of the views.\n\nBecause each step uses the output of the previous one, you’re effectively *building* a story: from a seed set, you find a module, validate it biologically, then broaden the search to the whole network and validate that list too.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Multiple Seed Sets**\n\nYou can define several seed lists in the same workspace:\n\n| Seed Set | Example | What you might analyze |\n|----------|---------|------------------------|\n| **Set A** | TP53, BRCA1 | DIAMOnD for breast cancer module |\n| **Set B** | APP, PSEN1 | DIAMOnD for Alzheimer’s module |\n| **Set C** | LKB1, AMPK | TrustRank to find metabolic regulators |\n\nRun each algorithm on each set independently, or even cross‑compare modules (e.g., overlap between Set A and Set B modules).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Hybrid Approaches**\n\n- **Seed‑plus‑filter**: Run DIAMOnD, then take the resulting module and use it as a *new* seed set for TrustRank, focusing the ranking inside the module.\n- **Overlay‑driven**: Run TrustRank, but filter the ranked list to only genes that appear in a literature overlay, then Digest those.\n\nThe UI lets you pick which results feed into the next step; you don’t have to do it manually.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Practical Tips**\n\n- **Save a “Session” after each major combination**: Gives you a snapshot you can reload later or share with collaborators.\n- **Keep parameters in a table**: Write down `k`, `α`, top‑N numbers, etc. so you can reproduce the analysis.\n- **Use the “Compare” view**: Some interfaces allow two network panels side‑by‑side; great for juxtaposing a module against a global ranking.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nYou’re free to run as many analyses as you like, in any order, on any seed set. ChatDREx is designed to let you layer tools conceptually—just choose the algorithm(s) that answer your current question, feed the results into the next step, and keep everything saved and exportable.

  "answer" : "## “What to avoid” – Quick Pitfalls for a New ChatDREx User  \n\n| # | What to avoid | Why it hurts | How to steer clear |\n|---|----------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Using ambiguous or misspelled gene symbols** | The system will treat an unknown symbol as a blank or auto‑correct to the wrong gene, giving you a meaningless network. | Verify symbols against the HGNC database or use the “Gene lookup” helper. |\n| **2. Over‑loading the network with too many seeds at once** | The default PPI map has ~20 k proteins; too many seeds can make the module huge, confusing the algorithm and blowing up the interface. | Start with a small set (1–5 genes) and expand gradually. |\n| **3. Ignoring the *damping factor* in TrustRank** | A high damping factor (close to 1) will keep “trust” stuck at the seeds; a very low factor will let trust leak everywhere, giving a noisy ranking. | Try α = 0.8–0.9 for most cases, and look at the top‑ranked nodes for sanity. |\n| **4. Running DIAMOnD with an extremely large target size (k)** | The algorithm will add many low‑confidence nodes, turning a tight module into a random cluster. | Keep k in the range 20–60 for most seed sets, and check the enrichment after each run. |\n| **5. Treating the enrichment table as definitive “evidence”** | Statistical significance (p‑value, FDR) is just a filter; biological context still matters. | Cross‑check top terms with literature or known pathways. |\n| **6. Not saving sessions** | If you close the browser or get disconnected, you lose the parameter settings and intermediate results. | Click **Save Session** after every major run and label it clearly. |\n| **7. Using the same seeds for both DIAMOnD and TrustRank without a clear goal** | The two outputs can look similar but serve different purposes; confusing them can lead to redundant work. | Decide first: do you want a module or a ranking? Then run only what’s needed. |\n| **8. Over‑overlaying too many data layers** | Too many color codes can clutter the map, making it hard to spot true patterns. | Toggle overlays on/off one at a time, and keep a legend visible. |\n| **9. Ignoring species or background when running Digest** | If you use a human gene list but set a mouse background, enrichment will be misleading. | Make sure the background matches the species of your seed list. |\n| **10. Expecting instant “answers” from the network** | Networks reflect known biology and data quality; missing connections or biases can hide true relationships. | Treat results as hypotheses, not proofs. Validate with experiments or additional databases. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Dos & Don’ts” Checklist\n\n| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |\n|------|----------|\n| Verify gene symbols. | Assume every input symbol is correct. |\n| Start with a small seed set. | Flood the network with dozens of seeds. |\n| Save a session after each run. | Forget to save, risking lost work. |\n| Check the enrichment output against biology. | Take the top‑10 terms at face value. |\n| Keep overlays to a few key layers. | Overload the map with every dataset at once. |\n| Use sensible parameters (k, α). | Set extreme values without testing first. |\n| Interpret results as hypotheses. | Claim the module is the “final answer.” |\n\nIf you steer clear of these common missteps, you’ll get clearer, more reliable insights from ChatDREx and spend less time troubleshooting.
