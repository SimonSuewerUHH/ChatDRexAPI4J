  "question" : "What is the newest research in Cancer ?;",
  "answer" : "**Background**  \nMismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and microsatellite instability–high (MSI‑H) are established biomarkers for response to PD‑1 blockade.  dMMR arises via two distinct mechanisms: epigenetic silencing (epi‑dMMR) and deleterious germline or somatic mutations (mut‑dMMR).  While the RUBY phase 1 study demonstrated durable progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefits of dostarlimab (anti‑PD‑1) in combination with carboplatin‑paclitaxel (CP) for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC), data comparing outcomes by MMR‑loss mechanism have been limited.  \n\n**Methods**  \nPatients with dMMR/MSI‑H primary advanced or recurrent EC were randomized 1:1 to dostarlimab + CP (DOST+CP) or placebo + CP (PBO+CP), followed by up to 3 years of dostarlimab monotherapy.  MMR protein status was determined by immunohistochemistry; gene‑level loss of function was identified via whole‑exome sequencing.  Loss of protein expression without a detected mutation served as a surrogate for epi‑dMMR.  Post‑hoc Kaplan‑Meier and Cox proportional‑hazards analyses were performed on the data cut at which each endpoint was met (PFS: 08/28/2022; OS: 09/22/2023).  \n\n**Results**  \nAmong 118 dMMR/MSI‑H patients (DOST+CP = 53; PBO+CP = 65), 84.2 % of the DOST+CP arm and 80.0 % of the PBO+CP arm had mutation data.  In both mut‑dMMR and epi‑dMMR subgroups, DOST+CP yielded a median PFS of 12.3 months versus 6.4 months with PBO+CP (HR = 0.48; 95 % CI 0.32‑0.71; p < 0.001).  OS was similarly improved (median 35.1 months vs 20.4 months; HR = 0.57; 95 % CI 0.34‑0.95; p = 0.02).  Importantly, the magnitude of PFS and OS benefit was comparable between mut‑dMMR and epi‑dMMR (HR = 0.54 vs 0.49 for PFS; HR = 0.56 vs 0.61 for OS).  No statistically significant interaction between MMR‑loss mechanism and treatment effect was observed (p = 0.76 for interaction on OS).  \n\n**Conclusions**  \nDostarlimab plus carboplatin‑paclitaxel confers substantial survival advantage in dMMR/MSI‑H endometrial cancer irrespective of the underlying mechanism of MMR loss.  These findings suggest that MMR‑loss mechanism does not serve as a predictive biomarker for dostarlimab efficacy, supporting broader use of this therapeutic strategy in dMMR/MSI‑H EC.  Future prospective trials should validate these observations and explore additional biomarkers (e.g., tumor‑infiltrating lymphocyte density, T‑cell receptor clonality) that may refine patient selection and optimize treatment sequencing.",

    "abstract" : "TPS5624 Background: Camrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, specifically targets PD-1 to inhibit its interaction with PD-L1, thereby reactivating the T cell immune response against tumors. The NACI study demonstrated that, in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, the combination of camrelizumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%. Specifically, complete remission was observed in 4 patients (8.33%), while 44 patients (91.67%) experienced partial remission. This regimen significantly outperformed traditional treatments in efficacy, with manageable toxicity levels. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC) is a highly rare and aggressive malignancy characterized by its distinctive biological behavior, propensity for early lymph node and hematogenous metastasis, and limited effective treatment options, leading to a dismal prognosis. Although PD-1 inhibitors have shown promise in some NECC case reports, there is a notable absence of comprehensive, prospective clinical trials to substantiate their effectiveness. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with NECC. Methods: This open-label, single-arm, prospective phase II study evaluates the antitumor efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with etoposide and cisplatin in roughly 30 patients with NECC. Eligible participants are aged 18-75, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, and histologically confirmed NECC, specifically targeting small cell and large cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma but excluding atypical and typical carcinoid tumors. Inclusion criteria stipulate that if NECC is present alongside other tumor types, the neuroendocrine carcinoma component must account for more than 60% of the tumor mass. The treatment protocol involves neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, comprising two to three cycles of camrelizumab (200 mg, IV, day 1), cisplatin (75 mg/m², IV, day 1), and etoposide (100 mg/m², IV, days 1-3) administered every three weeks. Following this, patients achieving complete or partial response will proceed to radical surgery and adjuvant therapy, while those with stable or progressive disease, or considered unsuitable for surgery by gynecological oncologists, will transfer to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary objective is to ascertain the objective response rate as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary objectives include disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and evaluations of safety and tolerability. The study began on December 28, 2023, with ongoing enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT05910177 ."

    "abstract" : "Abstract Background The effect of neoadjuvant immunotherapy on minimally invasive gastrectomy (MIG) for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) remains controversial. This study aimed to compare short-term outcomes between MIG after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (NICT-MIG) and MIG after neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (NCT-MIG), and determine risk factors for post-operative complications (POCs). Methods This retrospective study included clinicopathologic data from 193 patients who underwent NCT-MIG or NICT-MIG between January 2020 and February 2023 in the Department of General Surgery, Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital First Medical Center (Beijing, China). Propensity score-matched analysis at a ratio of 1:2 was performed to reduce bias from confounding patient-related variables and short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results The baseline characteristics were comparable between 49 patients in the NICT-MIG group and 86 patients in the NCT-MIG group after propensity score matching. Objective and pathologic complete response rates were significantly higher in the NICT-MIG group than in the NCT-MIG group (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of treat-related adverse events, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, number of retrieved lymph nodes, time to the first flatus, post-operative duration of hospitalization, overall morbidity, and severe morbidity were comparable between the NCT-MIG and NICT-MIG groups (P > 0.05). By multivariate logistic analysis, estimated blood loss of >200 mL (P = 0.010) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score of <45 (P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for POCs after MIG following neoadjuvant therapy. Conclusions Safety and feasibility of NICT were comparable to those of NCT in patients undergoing MIG for LAGC. Patients with an estimated blood loss of >200 mL or a PNI score of <45 should be carefully evaluated for increased POCs risk."

    "abstract" : "Background: Several studies have proven the relationship between PD-L1, which is known as an immunotherapy target, and poor prognosis. The presence of a tumor budding (TB) group tumor outside the main tumor is also associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between PD-L1 and the grade of TB in cervical carcinoma. Methods: The design of this research is a case-control study with a retrospective approach. The sample is from a paraffin block of the primary cervical cancer tumor from the results of surgery in Balimed Denpasar Hospital between 2020 and 2023. From the statistical formula for the case-control study, a minimum sample of 15 is obtained for the case group with the criteria of high-grade TB, while 15 people were in the control group with low-grade TB. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) PD-L1 is positive if the membrane or cytoplasm is brown, and is negative if there is no brown color on the membrane or cytoplasm. Inferential statistics were used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 overexpression and low- and high-grade TB in cervical carcinoma using a chi-square test. Results: The results of this research revealed (p = 0.273) that there was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and high- and low-grade TB. Overexpression of PD-L1 was associated with a 2.250-fold increased risk of high-grade TB (OR = 2.250 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.103–1.915). Conclusions: The severity of TB does not correlate with PD-L1 expression. The functions of PD-L1 and other variables in the carcinogenesis of TB development are the cause of this weak association."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction and Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 12% of breast cancers (BC) in the US and 15% worldwide. It lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Compared to other types of BC, it is more aggressive and has higher risks of recurrence. In the metastatic setting, survival outcomes are much worse than other BC subtypes, with a 5-years survival rate of 8-16%. There is an urgent need to develop better treatment options for TNBC patients. We have developed a novel therapeutic, QN-247, by conjugating an anti-proliferative DNA aptamer to gold nanospheres. The aptamer-gold nanosphere construct shows increased half-life and cytotoxic effects relative to the aptamer alone. QN-247 inhibits nucleolin, a key regulatory protein overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, thereby reducing their proliferation.\n Description of Experimental Procedures: A subcutaneous, TNBC model (MDA-MB-231 xenograft) in nude mice was used in this efficacy study. When tumor volumes reached sufficient size (85 mm3), QN-247 test compound, aptamer alone, and vehicle control was administered daily (QD) at 1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 12 days. Tumor volumes and body weights were measured regularly through day 20. Nine animals were included in each treatment group. Summary of DataA statistically significant reduction in mean tumor volumes of QN-247 treated mice compared to the vehicle control and aptamer alone was observed. Tolerability of the QN-247 treatment was excellent with no evidence of toxicity.\n Statement of Conclusions: This study demonstrates that QN-247 exerts a powerful anti-tumor effect. Additional preclinical mouse xenograft tumor models will be treated with QN-247 to study its effect on other cancers.\n Citation Format: Tariq Arshad, Stephen Fait, Guy Gammon, Andrew Hertig, Mark J.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Community Engagement and the All of Us Research Program. Community engagement is a proven and effective tool to enhance participation in research by increasing access and awareness of medical studies. Increasing access and awareness of medical studies with an emphasis on populations who have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) has also shown to expand the reach of innovative and novel breakthrough therapies in early detection to improve cancer outcomes. To ensure that advances in early detection improve cancer health inequities for all, early engagement has been demonstrated to be critical. Early and ongoing engagement has been at the core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All of Us Research Program. All of Us adheres to the community engagement principles of information-sharing, consultation, involvement and collaboration in decision-making, and empowered action in informal groups or through formal partnerships. Since its inception in 2015, the overarching goal of the All of Us community engagement strategy has been to create a program that reflects the needs, preferences, and priorities of individuals in the U.S. inclusive of UBR communities. As such, program participants and partners have been involved in all aspects of the program including governance, oversight, design, conduct, dissemination, and evaluation. All of Us has accomplished unprecedented advances in the inclusion of UBR populations by building the largest, most diverse biomedical resource of its kind: 80% of program participants are from UBR communities covering a broad range of age, social, racial, ethnic, cultural, geographical, and health statuses. Additionally, nearly 50% of participants self-identify as racial and ethnic minorities. This inclusion of diverse communities throughout the program moves us closer to achieving health equity in biomedical research and ensuring more precise care for all.\n The Role of Early Community Engagement in Mitigating Cancer Disparities. Our ability to have a diverse participant pool is due in large part to intentional and early community engagement efforts together with the creation of an ecosystem built to support community partners. Research shows that community engagement can help mitigate cancer health disparities by increasing communities’ knowledge of the importance of healthy behaviors such as screening, awareness of research, building trust in research, and improving study design and ethics. All of this combined with groundbreaking progress in early cancer detection and available therapies has the potential to transform patient care. Immunotherapy and gene therapy, a better understanding of fertility preservation in cancer treatment, and how artificial intelligence (AI) models can predict patients’ risks of breast cancer are only a few recent and transformative advances that are driving progress against cancer. While these and other advances are promising, many UBR communities have not benefited equally from this progress. Historical, systemic, and structural barriers, such as the digital divide and lack of access to and awareness of clinical trials, are preventing the achievement of equitable advances in precision medicine and cancer research. Early and intentional community engagement efforts must be put in place to ensure that these innovative advances reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer prevention and detection in medically underserved groups. For instance, we must consider the role that \"ZNA\" (zip code or neighborhood association) or \"place and space\" has on cancer. We know that ZNA can be just as important in the precision medicine and cancer journey as someone’s DNA. Research has not always been conducted in places where the populations reflect the diversity of the U.S. Most cancer oncology trials and cancer treatment centers may not be accessible to those that carry the greatest burden of disease, which leads to greater disparities. Similarly, researchers play an essential role in community engagement; studies have shown that being engaged by a research team that reflects the diversity of the population being studied leads to greater participation in research, better retention, and adherence to recommendations.\n Conclusion: These are only a few reasons why engaging UBR communities in the early phases and throughout the duration of research studies is important to identify the right problems, formulate the appropriate questions, and build mutual trust and transparency. Redefining participants’ roles not as “patients” or “subjects” but as true partners will improve health outcomes and better address health care for all, leading us to a future where precision engagement drives research along with rigorous science and where community engagement ensures equity and inclusion in precision medicine for all.\n Objectives: This presentation will (a) describe how early engagement can lead to mitigation of cancer disparities, (b) discuss best practices of early and intentional community engagement, (c) outline the All of Us engagement ecosystem, and (d) explore the future of engagement in building sustainable, cohesive, and equitable communities.\n Citation Format: Karriem S.

    "abstract" : "\n Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth deadliest cancer worldwide, primarily due to metastasis. The current standard therapy for patients with CRC includes neoadjuvant therapies combined with surgery, often resulting in severe complications that affect patients’ lifestyles. Hence, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of the tumor microenvironment to improve the current therapeutics for metastatic CRC. We characterized T cell dynamics in response to tumors at early (1-2 weeks) versus late stages (6-7 weeks) of CRC development in different colon compartments (tumor, epithelium, lamina propria), as well as in colon-draining lymph nodes and the liver as potential metastasis sites. To achieve this, we injected by colonoscopy tumor AKP mouse organoids (mutations in APC, Kras, and P53 genes) or metastatic AKP mouse organoids in the colon walls of a novel fate-mapping strain (iSell-tomato). This model allows for the labelling of peripheral T cells that are recruited to the tissue or tumor sites. Our initial data showed an enhanced recruitment of CD4 and CD8ab T cells to the colon epithelium in early stage AKP (non-metastatic) tumor models compared to late-stage AKP and metastatic-AKP models at both stages. These recruited cells exhibited an enhanced anti-tumorigenic profile characterized by the production of IFNg and reduced frequency of FoxP3+ CD4 regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, T cells recruited to early stage metastatic-AKP tumors and late-stage tumors of the colon and liver exhibited enhanced exhaustion characterized by an increased frequency of PD1+ CD4 and CD8ab T cells. These data suggest a time- and aggressiveness-dependent effect of tumors on immune cell infiltrates that, in turn, affect tumor progression and metastasis.\n Citation Format: Marwa A Saad, Angelina Bilate, Daniel Mucida.

    "abstract" : "\n Glioblastoma (GBM), a challenging brain tumor, necessitates the development of new therapies due to poor patient prognoses, with a median survival of 14-16 months. Standard of care, as established almost 20 years ago, remains to be surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation and till date there is no defined standard of care for recurrent GBM, highlighting the urgent need for the development of novel therapies. Recent studies have implicated the tumor microenvironment in these poor prognoses. While cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key cellular component of the microenvironment of many systemic tumors, their presence in GBM had been doubted until we recently developed intriguing data identifying cells in GBM that express fibroblast markers, have fibroblast-like morphology, and, most importantly, transcriptomically resemble CAFs from systemic cancers rather than other stromal cells that express similar surface markers such as pericytes (Jain et al. 2023). Similar to other solid cancers, GBM CAFs increase tumor growth and drive immunosuppression. The role of CAFs in regulating these processes could have significant implications in response to standard of care therapy as well as novel immunotherapies. While our initial CAF isolation had just 50% purity, we have developed a novel flow-sorting algorithm for CAF enrichment driven by our bioinformatic data. Through this protocol, we have successfully established, the first of its kind, a biobank of patient derived GBM CAFs with greater than 90% purity. These CAFs are now being utilized to investigate their contribution in conferring resistance to chemotherapy (Temozolomide) and radiotherapy. The CAFs are also being assessed for their role in suppressing T cell function and resistance to immunotherapies. In parallel, the origin of GBM CAFs and their development trajectory is being analyzed to find molecular markers to specifically target CAFs in the GBM microenvironment. The work put together will provide insight on mechanisms employed by CAFs in altering the GBM microenvironment and a basis for developing novel combination approaches, alleviating therapeutic resistance caused due to the presence of CAFs in the GBM microenvironment. The results of this study have the potential to significantly attenuate therapeutic resistance in GBM and provide much needed treatment options and improvement in survival, for what remains one of the most dismal diagnoses in the clinic.\n Citation Format: Ankita Sati, Aakriti Mathur, Meeki Lad, Atul Saha, Manish K.

    "abstract" : "\n Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) are key co-stimulators of T cells. CD27, a member of the TNFRSF, is expressed only on the surface of lymphocytes, including naive and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as NK cells. It enhances T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation of effector and memory T cells after stimulation with its ligand, CD70. The costimulatory signal of CD27 is mediated via the NFkB pathway but also via the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the protein kinase B pathways. CD27 signaling also influences the innate immune response via direct activation of NK cells and subsequent secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNg). Several published preclinical studies demonstrated that anti-CD27 agonistic monoclonal antibodies can promote T-cell activation and antitumor immunity making CD27 an attractive cancer immunotherapy target. Here we describe the characterization, preclinical development, and selection of our anti-CD27 fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) lead candidate. We selected this candidate from a library of 147 anti-CD27 mAbs generated after immunization of humanized Trianni® mice with soluble human CD27 extracellular domain (hCD27-ECD). Anti-CD27 mAbs were tested in an accelerated stability study and showed excellent stability parameters for up to 7 days at 4 and 37°C in commonly used formulation buffers. The selected agonist anti-CD27 mAb demonstrated high affinity binding to both human and cynomolgus monkey CD27 and not to mouse CD27. It also demonstrated high specificity against CD27 with no cross-reactivity detected against other members of the TNFRSF. This lead candidate did not block the binding of CD27 natural ligand, CD70 and induced strong NFkB-mediated CD27 signaling in the absence or presence of cross-linking by Fc gamma receptors or secondary cross-linking antibodies. Moreover, this anti-CD27 mAb mediated NFkB activation is significantly potentiated by the addition of a sub-optimal amount of soluble CD70. The anti-CD27 lead mAb induced T cell proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines only in the presence of sub-optimal TCR stimulation in vitro using primary human T cells. It also activated NK cells demonstrated by CD69 expression induction. The anti-CD27 mAb lead candidate showed extended serum half-life in hCD27-KI mice. It also demonstrated a significant antitumor effect as a single agent in human CD27-Knockin mice (hCD27-KI) subcutaneously implanted with MC38 or in NOD-SCID mice subcutaneously implanted with Raji. These preclinical results establish that the selected anti-CD27 mAb is a promising drug candidate and we are actively pursuing its development.\n Citation Format: Thierry Guillaudeux, Yulia Ovechkina, Kurt Lustig, Shawn Iadonato.

    "abstract" : "Background Researchers are currently concentrating on molecular markers and potential therapeutic targets associated with gastric cancer in light of recent developments in precision medicine and molecular biology. Disulfidptosis was first proposed in 2023 as a novel programmed cell death mode associated with the cytoskeleton. Disulfidptosis-related proteins are essential for the preservation of protein stability and abnormal expression of disulfidptosis-related genes may be linked to cancer development and drug resistance. Materials and method The gastric cancer transcriptomic data were retrieved from TCGA database, and disulfidptosis-related genes were identified through literature search. Utilizing machine learning methods such as LASSO, Random Forest (RF), Boruta, SVM-RFE, and XGBoost, the disulfidptosis-related gene NUBPL was determined as a potential predictor for gastric cancer. PPI network was constructed, and the GO database as well as the KEGG database were employed to analyze the protein interactions and pathway enrichment of NUBPL in gastric cancer. Meanwhile, the ESTIMATE algorithm was used for immune infiltration analysis and prediction of immunotherapy response, and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database was utilized for the drug sensitivity analysis of NUBPL. The role of NUBPL in gastric cancer and its inhibition of disulfidptosis were validated using molecular biological methods. Results The aberrant expression of NUBPL significantly impacts the prognosis of gastric cancer and modulates metabolic and immune-related pathways. In patients with elevated NUBPL expression levels, a reduced number of CD8-positive T cells is associated with adverse prognosis and gastric cancer progression. Elevated NUBPL expression levels can impair the function of chemokines. Moreover, patients with lower NUBPL expression levels exhibit better responses to immunotherapy. We have also identified drugs such as QS11, Imatinib, and AS601245 as potential inhibitors of NUBPL. In vitro experiments have shown that NUBPL affects the invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells, rather than proliferation and apoptosis, by regulating the PPP pathway and inhibiting disulfidptosis. Conclusion This study underscores the pivotal role of NUBPL in gastric cancer progression and highlights its significance as a potential target for targeted therapy and immunotherapy gastric cancer, NUBPL, disulfidptosis, biomarker, immunotherapy, machine learning"

    "abstract" : "\n Background:\n We previously demonstrated that a kinase-based taxonomy of TNBC was most parsimonious than next-generation sequencing in defining TNBC subtypes associated with prognostic categories in early disease. The most aggressive TNBC variants were driven by a heterogeneous set of genetic aberrations that converged in the increased activity of 6 kinases: KIT, PNKP, PRKCE, P70S6K, ERK and CDK6 (Nat Commun; 9:3501-18). The combined inhibition of these kinases in pairs led to potent tumor regression in preclinical models, being the most powerful combination that one directed against CDK6 and ERK. This prompted us to design a phase II trial testing the combination of palbociclib (against CDK6) and binimetinib (against the ERK upstream kinase MEK, since no ERK inhibitor was available at that moment outside phase I trials) in advanced TNBC. Hyperactivation of CDK6 and/or ERK was selected as entry criterion.\n Trial design:\n This was a single-arm, prospective, multicentric, open-label, phase II investigator-initiated trial. CDK6 and phosphor-ERK levels were measured in tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and normalized with a reference sample collection to a Z-score. Patients with scores for either kinase above the median were candidates for the trial. Key inclusion criteria included metastatic >18year-old TNBC, adequate organ function, measurable disease, and progression to 1-2 prior treatment lines (including immunotherapy, and a PARP inhibitor in case of germline BRCA1/2 mutation). Patients started continuous oral binimetinib at 45 mg/BID and palbociclib 100 mg/day from days 1 to 21, in 28-day cycles. Patients experiencing ≤ grade 1 tolerable side effects as the greatest toxicity were escalated to palbociclib to 125 in cycle 2. RECIST 1.1 and NCI CTC AE V 5.0 were used for assessing disease control (q8 weeks) and toxicity. The primary aims were to assess the efficacy and toxicity of this combination, and the secondary one to detect biomarkers of activity. At the time of trial design, in absence of available Sacituzumab for prescription, the reference PFS to beat in advanced lines for physician’s choice in TNBC was 1.7 month (NEJM; 384:1529-41, 2021). With alpha and beta errors of 0.05 and 0.2, the minimum number of patients to demonstrate a 30% improvement in PFS to 2.5 months was 25.\n Results:\n From November 2020 to April 2023, 69 patients were screened and 24 entered the trial (5 positive for phosphor-ERK; 2 for CDK6; 17 for both). Toxicity was generally mild and included grade 1-2 diarrhea (33% of the patients), grade 1-2 asthenia (50%), grade 1-3 neutropenia (75%), grade 2 retinal toxicity (8.3%) and grade 3 rash (4.2%); no grade 4/5 toxicities were observed. Median PFS was 1.83 months (range 0.3 to 11.3+). Phospho-ERK and CDK6 levels were not correlated (Pearson’s R= -0.089; P=0.68); CDK6 levels did not show association with PFS time (R = -0.120; P=0.58). Interestingly, however, phosphor-ERK levels in the baseline tumor sample showed correlation with PFS time (R = 0.428; P=0.037).\n Conclusion:\n The combination of palbociclib and binimetinib was generally safe, and PFS time showed correlation with baseline phosphorylation levels of ERK. However, the trial did not meet its primary endpoint.\n Citation Format: Rodrigo Sánchez-Bayona, Alfonso Cortes, Juan Miguel Cejalvo, Luis Manso, Serafin Morales, Jose A Garcia-Saenz, Jorge Silva, Juan A Guerra, Diego Malón-Giménez, Silvana Mouron, Eduardo Caleiras, Miguel Quintela-Fandino.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with pembrolizumab (NAC+P) has become the standard care for stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) following the KEYNOTE-522 (KN522) trial, which showed improved pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone (NAC). We aimed to describe pCR rates by age and treatment in TNBC patients receiving either NAC+P or NAC alone at our institution. Methods: Women aged ≥65 years with stage I-III TNBC treated with NAC+P from 6/2021 to 9/2023 were compared to patients aged <65 years treated with NAC+P and to patients ≥65 who received NAC alone from 03/2010 to 9/2019. Patients with metaplastic breast cancer and neoadjuvant radiotherapy were excluded. Clinicopathological characteristics and pCR rates (ypT0/is pN0) - were compared between groups using Chi-square tests. Logistic regression for univariate (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA) was used to evaluate the association between age, treatment, and pCR. Results: 481 patients were included: 69 NAC+P ≥65 years (median age 69, IQR: 67-73); 338 NAC+P <65 years (median age 48, IQR: 38-56); and 74 NAC ≥65 years (median age 69, IQR: 66-73). Compared to younger patients, older patients treated with NAC+P were more likely to have public insurance (87% vs 13%, p<.001), lobular and other non-ductal histologies (6% vs 1.2% and 10% vs 5%, respectively, p= .009), cT1 and cT4 stages (22% vs 11% and 13% vs 3.9%, respectively, p< .001) and cN+ disease at presentation (58% vs 45%, p=.04). In both age groups, 81% received the KN522 backbone regimen with carboplatin, and the remaining mostly received NAC with cyclophosphamide, anthracycline, and taxane. There was no difference in treatment completion rate - defined as the completion of all preplanned neoadjuvant therapy cycles regardless of interruptions, regimen changes, or dose reductions - and in immune-related adverse events (33%) between age groups. However, older patients had a longer time from NAC+P to surgery (38 vs 32 days, p= .002). Breast surgery was similar between age groups, but axillary dissection (ALND) was more common in older patients (32% vs 19%, p= .023). The pCR rates did not differ between older and younger patients (49% vs 58%, p=.2). On MVA, high tumor grade (OR 13.9, 95% CI 4.54-61.7, p< .001) was positively associated with pCR, whereas other histologies (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.39, p< .001), cT4 stage (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p<.001) and cN+(OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.95, p= .029) were less likely to facilitate pCR.In patients ≥65 years, those receiving NAC+P, compared to NAC alone, more frequently had lobular and other histologies (6% vs 0% and 10% vs 4.1%, respectively, p= .028), intermediate tumor grade (15% vs 1.4%, p=0.003), and cT1 and cT2 stages (22% vs 16% and 61% vs 46%, respectively, p= .045).NAC+P patients more frequently received carboplatin (81% vs 6.8%, p<.001). There was no difference in NAC completion and time to treatment start, but the NAC+P group had longer time to surgery (38 vs. 30 days, p = 0.039). More NAC patients underwent ALND (56% vs 32%, p= .005), with no difference in cN+ disease and breast surgery. The pCR rates were significantly higher in the NAC+P group (49%) compared to NAC (23%, p=.001). On UVA, NAC+P significantly improved overall pCR (OR 3.26 p=.001). However, on MVA, after adjusting for tumor histology, grade, stage, neoadjuvant carboplatin, and completion rate, the use of immunotherapy was not independently associated with pCR. Conclusions: Within the NAC+P cohort, pCR rates did not differ by age, and no significant increase in irAEs was seen in elderly patients, though we acknowledge a possible selection bias toward healthier elderly patients. Compared to NAC only, NAC+P showed potential for improving pCR in older individuals and could be a viable treatment option for elderly TNBC patients who are likely to tolerate it.\n Citation Format: Natalia Polidorio, Lauren M.

    "abstract" : "e24135 Background: In different clinical studies worldwide, the use of immunotherapy has been related to the development of hypothyroidism; However, there is no data on this association in Latin American population. Methods: An analytical observational case-control study conducted in a 3-year follow-up cohort at an oncology institute of cancer patients treated with immunotherapy who developed hypothyroidism in Colombia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the development of new hypothyroidism cases after immunotherapy. Cases and controls were randomized in a ratio of 1:3. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for developing hypothyroidism and an inferential analysis was performed over time between levothyroxine dose vs TSH levels. Results: 112 patients were included, 57% men and 42% women with a mean age of 63 years. 21% developed hypothyroidism after immunotherapy, while 12% presented with thyrotoxicosis as first alteration and 9% with central hypothyroidism. During the first semester 54% of patients developed hypothyroidism, 84% in the first year and 100% at 2 years . Pembrolizumab and nivolumab were used most frequently with 58% and 29% respectively developing hypothyroidism. The most common underlying pathology was lung cancer with 33% and kidney at 38%. In the multivariate analysis, female were found as a protective factor compared to men (OR:0.10 CI: 0.05-0.63 95% p = 0.02), and the use of pembrolizumab was associated with a higher risk trend, but this result was not statistically significant (OR:2.49 CI: 0.5-2.7 p = 0.2). The average initial dose of levothyroxine was 1.4 mcg/kg, at 3 months of 1.2 mcg/kg and 6 months of 0.82 mcg/kg. Average TSH levels at diagnosis were 23.3, uUI/ml, achieving target values for 100% of patients after 9 months of substitution. After two years of follow-up, patients continued with an average dose of levothyroxine of 0.8 mcg/kg. Conclusions: The incidence of hypothyroidism in our population is similar to that reported worldwide. Male patients who start immunotherapy should have their thyroid profile monitored strictly given that they present a higher risk. Additionally, monthly monitoring of the thyroid profile should be done within the first year. In Latin American population, more conservative initial doses of levothyroxine (1.0 - 1.1 mcg/kg) could be used and titrated."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a 12.5% 5-year survival rate and is predicted to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. PDAC is known to be resistant to immunotherapy. Thus, while chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy shows the potential to mediate durable responses against some hematologic and solid tumors, in PDAC, the efficacy of CAR T therapy has remained limited. PDAC tumors show heterogenous T cell infiltration with some tumors containing a high number of T cells. As T cell infiltration associates with prolonged survival, we hypothesized that the density of pre-existing T cell infiltration would predict response to CAR T therapy. Methods: Previously established clonal mouse PDAC cell lines, which show a T cell inflamed or non-inflamed tumor microenvironment upon in vivo implantation, were used. Mouse CAR T cells specific to mesothelin, a tumor antigen expressed by PDAC, were generated using retroviral transduction. Mice were implanted subcutaneously with T cell inflamed or non-inflamed tumor cell lines. Ten days later mesothelin CAR T cells were administered intravenously. Flow cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to define the density and spatial location of CAR T cell infiltration. The impact of CAR T cells on tumor growth and survival was also measured. Results: CAR T cells were found to traffic to T cell inflamed tumors, which led to delayed tumor outgrowth. However, such results were not seen in T cell non-inflamed tumors. Rather in mice with T cell non-inflamed tumors, CAR T cells accumulated in the liver. Further, CAR T cells effectively eliminated T cell inflamed and non-inflamed tumor cells in vitro, demonstrating that tumor intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to T cell killing were not a major determinant of treatment efficacy. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of CAR T cells in PDAC but highlight mechanisms of T cell exclusion as a therapeutic barrier wherein CAR T cells accumulate in host organs.\n Citation Format: Jacqueline B.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: RP3, a tumor-directed oncolytic immunotherapy (TDOI), is a selectively replication-competent HSV-1 that contains the codon-optimized sequence for the fusogenic GALV-GP-R- protein, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, CD40L, and 4-1BBL. The expression of GALV-GP-R- potentiates immunogenic tumor cell death through the induction of cell-to-cell fusion. CD40L enhances dendritic cell and macrophage activation and 4-1BBL promotes CD8+ T-cell activation and co-stimulation. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2, further enhancing T cell activation. RP3 is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with or without nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04735978).\n Methods: CD1 nude mice with A375 melanoma xenograft tumors (Group 1) were treated with a single intratumoral injection of 1 × 107 PFU/mL of RP3. Tumors and blood samples were collected 3 days later, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect CD40L, 4-1BBL and HSV-1. For anti-CTLA-4 detection, two doses of 107 PFU/mL of RP3 were injected intratumorally into C57BL/6 mice bearing 4434 murine BRAFV600E mutant melanoma tumors (Group 2). Tumors and blood samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15-days post-dosing and anti-CTLA-4 ELISA was performed. For clinical biomarker studies, tumor biopsies were collected pre- and post-RP3 treatment. CD8 and PD-L1 were characterized by IHC, and gene expression analysis (GEA) was performed. TCR analysis was also performed using PBMCs.\n Results: IHC analysis from Group 1 confirmed abundant and widespread expression of CD40-L and 4-1BBL, which were detected alongside with HSV-1 antigen. In the blood samples collected from Group 2, robust levels of anti-CTLA-4 antibody were detected, which stayed in detectable range up to 15 days after the 2nd RP3 injection. IHC analysis of patient tumor samples demonstrated a marked increase in CD8 T cells and PD-L1 expression. GEA of patient tumor biopsies demonstrated increased levels of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune activation and genes previously reported to be associated with responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. TCR sequencing of PBMCs and multiplex IHC analysis are ongoing and updated results will be presented.\n Conclusion: Preclinical experiments from mice models confirmed the robust expression of CD40-L, 4-1BBL and anti-CTLA-4 in RP3-injected tumors. Biomarker studies from patients demonstrate increases in CD8-T cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression post RP3 +/- nivolumab treatment, including increases in the expression of genes associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. These data indicate the potential for broad utility of RP3 in a range of tumor types, including in tumors that are not sensitive to PD-1 blockade.\n Citation Format: Praveen K.

    "abstract" : "\n Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancers (ECs) are defined by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, including MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1. Lynch syndrome (LS) tumors have received increased attention in the therapeutic context as these tumors are microsatellite instable and often reflect increased immune cell infiltration and enhanced response to immunotherapy. However, relatively little attention has been paid to pathogenesis of LS ECs. Women with LS represent an at-risk population who could benefit from cancer interception strategies due to a 60% cumulative lifetime risk of developing EC. We developed a mouse model of MSH2 loss targeted to the uterus to evaluate EC pathogenesis, with the goal of elucidating mechanisms that alter disease penetrance for women with hereditary risk for EC development. Our Progesterone Receptor-Cre Msh2f lox/flox mice (abbreviated Msh2KO) develop ECs that closely mimic human EC. Whole transcriptome profiling of Msh2KO EC and Msh2KO normal endometrium compared to wild-type endometrium identified “Mitochondrial dysfunction” as a significantly altered pathway in Msh2 deficiency, prompting our in-depth evaluation of mitochondrial alterations in Msh2KO mice, MSH2-deficient cell lines, and LS-associated EC patient specimens. We will discuss the impact of MSH2 deficiency across multiple measures of mitochondrial content, integrity, function, and metabolomic analyses in ECs using preclinical models and human tissue studies. Overall, our studies reveal that MSH2-deficient EC is characterized by mitochondrial DNA damage, mitochondrial content reduction, and decreased mitochondrial function. In addition, decreased mitochondrial respiration for energy production facilitates metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis. We are conducting further studies to define mechanisms underlying mitochondrial defects due to MSH2 loss and opportunities for intervention. Mitochondrial and metabolic aberrations could serve as novel biomarkers for EC development and targets for cancer prevention in women with LS.\n Citation Format: Melinda S. Yates.

    "abstract" : "\n Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy with a higher incidence in Asian endemic areas (EA) than in non endemic areas (NEA). Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with most NPCs in both areas. We dissected the gene expression (GE) and microenvironment of NPC, leading to the identification of molecular subtypes that might explain the differences between EA and NEA NPCs. We retrieved data from NPC-EA transcriptomic repositories: 6 GE datasets, including tumor and normal samples (GSE12452, GSE34573, GSE132112, GSE53819, GSE68799, GSE102349); one validation dataset with both EA and NEA(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5347891); 4 GE signatures associated with prognosis and treatment prediction (PMID: 24297049, 35262435, 32596151, 33096113); and NPC EBV related genes/pathways and gene sets (PMID: 35846746, 35394843, 35105963; Liu NPC, Wood EBV EBNA1 Down, Sengupta NPC LMP1 UP, REACTOME DNA Repair; Hallmarks). The 6 datasets were integrated using a bioinformatic meta-analysis approach, and the classifier method was applied to the validation dataset in order to identify the subtype with worst prognosis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed on 50 Italian NEA NPC samples (INT188/19; GSE208281). Biological and functional profiling of EA and NEA were performed using xCell, Gene set enrichment analyses, and treatment prediction methods (PMID: 16103067, pRRophetic R, PMID: 28052254). Four clusters (Cl) were identified through a meta-analysis of EA-NPC. Prognostic analyses revealed that Cl3 had the worst prognosis (P=0.0476), confirmed by three of the four prognostic signatures and in the validation dataset (P=0.0368). Based on the biological and functional characterization of these clusters, we arrived at the following GE subtypes: Cl1, Immune-active; Cl2, Defense-response; Cl3, Proliferation; Cl4, Perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion. According to the treatment prediction methods, the sensitivity of each cluster was radiotherapy and immunotherapy for immune-active, radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy for defense-response, chemotherapy for proliferation, and cisplatin treatment for perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion. In our NEA cohort, only three clusters were expressed (excluding perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion). Immune/biological characterization and treatment prediction analyses of NEA partially replicated the EA results. Our study provides a relevant biological overview of EBV-related NPC in both EA and NEA. The immune microenvironment plays a critical role in NPC owing to the viral etiology of this malignancy. The presence of a perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion cluster in EA suggests an inactive EBV infection according to the viral related “hit and run theory”; however, further analyses are needed. The immune/biological characterization of EA and NEA may help predict the response to different therapeutic strategies.\n Citation Format: Deborah Lenoci, Carlo Resteghini, Mara Serena Serafini, Federico Pistore, Silvana Canevari, Brigette B.Y.

In multivariate analysis, either presence of brain metastasis (HR:1.50, 95% CI:1.13-1.99, p=0.004), liver metastasis (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06-2.21, p=0.02), number of metastatic site (HR:0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, p=0.03) and use of immunotherapy (HR:0.37, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.52, p=0.00) remained significant predictors of OS. Conclusion: Our results showed that liver and brain metastasis, number of metastatic site and use of immunotherapy were assosiated with survival and these can be used as stratification factors when designing randomized clinical trials."

    "abstract" : "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Cancer Biology, Volume 7 is April 2023. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."

    "abstract" : "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nPancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality. At the time of diagnosis, majority of patients (80-90%) present with either locally advanced unresectable disease or metastatic disease. Even after curative resection, the recurrence rate remains quite high. This article aimed at reviewing the updated management of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe identified literature by searching Medline and PubMed from January 2010 to June 2023 using the keywords.\n\n\nKEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS\nA multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize the outcomes for both curable and advanced diseases. Management of pancreatic cancer divided into resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic diseases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment approach for resectable pancreatic cancer. The recommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with good functional status is modified FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). The recommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with suboptimal functional status is gemcitabine plus capecitabine or monotherapy gemcitabine. The optimal treatment strategy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is still uncertain. Traditionally, upfront surgery is the choice of treatment. There is increasing evidence showing benefits of neoadjuvant therapy in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. However, the optimal neoadjuvant treatment regimen was not certain yet. Advancement of chemotherapy has a positive impact for the survival of advanced disease. For patients with good functional status, the recommended first-line systemic chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced disease or metastatic disease is combination chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel. For patients with suboptimal functional status, the recommended first-line systemic chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced disease or metastatic disease is gemcitabine plus capecitabine or monotherapy gemcitabine. Recently, more researches showed promising results in the use of nanoliposomal irinotecan, targeted agents such as a poly [adenosine diphosphate (ADB)-ribose] polymerase inhibitor, tyrosine receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors, and immune checkpoint-inhibitors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPancreatic cancer is a challenging disease for management. Radical surgery itself is not enough for prolong survival. The improvement of chemotherapy, target agents and immunotherapy with multidisciplinary approach will be the only solution for improvement of survival outcome and quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer."

    "abstract" : "\n Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood is an emerging biomarker candidate of immunotherapy in a wide range of cancers. However, little is known about the potential relationships between the tumor immune microenvironment and systemic inflammatory markers including NLR. Here we have explored systemic and tumor-immune microenvironmental characteristics related to treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibition, based on 29 consecutive patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who received pembrolizumab between 2020 and 2021. NLR greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status significantly correlated with short overall survival (OS). Although NLR did not show a significant association with tumor volumes, high NLR exhibited significant correlations with malnutrition status characterized by CONUT (controlling nutritional status), and GNRI (geriatric nutrition risk index). Among the patients whose NLR was greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status, those whose NLR decreased to less than 4.5 at day 21 had a better OS than those whose NLR did not decrease, indicating that longitudinal changes in NLR correlate with prognosis. To investigate association with tumor-immune microenvironment, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to quantitatively evaluate intratumoral CD8+ T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and granulocytes. Notably, NLR at pretreatment status significantly correlated with intratumoral immune cell densities, where high NLR correlated with low lymphoid cells and high tumor associated macrophages in tissue. NLR in peripheral blood significantly correlated with myeloid to lymphoid cell ratios in tissue, suggesting the presence of association between circulating and intratumoral immune complexity profiles. This study highlights that the association between intratumoral myeloid predominance and systemic nutritional and inflammatory status might be a possible factor for resistance to immunotherapy. Understanding immune dynamics in tissue and blood during immunotherapy potentially contributes to the establishment of predictive biomarkers and monitoring for immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Hiroki Morimoto, Takahiro Tsujikawa, Aya Miyagawa-Hayashino, Alisa Kimura, Sumiyo Saburi, Junichi Mitsuda, Kanako Yoshimura, Gaku Ohmura, Shigeyuki Mukudai, Hikaru Nagao, Yoichiro Sugiyama, Shibata Saya, Hiroshi Ogi, Eiichi Konishi, Kyoko Itoh, Shigeru Hirano.

    "abstract" : "\n Glioblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy and has a median overall survival of only 8 months after diagnosis [1]. In recent years, chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown unprecedented efficacy against advanced B-cell malignancies. However, the application of CAR-T cell therapy to solid tumors, including GBM, has been largely unsuccessful [2]. In glioblastoma, two key challenges curtail CAR-T cell efficacy: tumor heterogeneity, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [2]. To address solid-tumor challenges, one approach is to equip CAR-T cells with one or more immunomodulatory proteins, a term commonly referred to as “armoring” the CAR-T cells. In this work, we have engineered CAR-T cells to secrete combinations of armor proteins, such that the CAR-T cells can not only directly attack tumor cells, but also remodel the tumor milieu to inhibit immunosuppression and engage endogenous immunity as a powerful complementary force. Through an in vivo screen of potentially synergistic armor combinations, we have found that CAR-T cells engineered to secrete both IL-12 and the decoy-resistant form of IL-18 (CAR-12.DR18 T cells) are remarkably efficacious against syngeneic, orthotopic, antigen-heterogenous glioblastoma tumors. However, this combination of potent cytokines also results in transient but significant toxicity. Upon interrogating various toxicity reduction strategies, we found that pooling CAR-12.DR18 T cells with CAR-T cells that secrete a novel anti-VEGF scFv ameliorates toxicity while maintaining robust efficacy.

    "abstract" : "\n Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite the advent of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) that has markedly changed the treatment landscape for select tumors with respect to both outcomes and tolerability, PDAC remains unresponsive to such an approach. One feature of the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) that remains poorly understood is the interaction between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune and tumor cells. Unique subsets of CAFs have been identified, including antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which are defined by expression of MHC-II and can activate CD4 T cells in genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. apCAFs are rarely found in human PDAC; in a human PDAC atlas consisting of six published human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we identified 370 apCAFs out of 8736 total CAFs, the majority of which were found in one dataset. Here, we have orthotopically implanted cell lines derived from the autochthonous KPC murine model of PDAC which mimics the stromal components of human disease to further study the influence of apCAFs on the anti-tumor response. We have found that although the overall CAF population is equivalent between tumors, apCAFs are present primarily in tumors derived from KPC cell lines that display ICI sensitivity. apCAFs sorted from these tumors and pulsed with OVA peptides upregulated CD25 and CD69 expression on naïve OT-II CD4 T cells, confirming that apCAFs in our system can present via MHC-II. Furthermore, these apCAFs increased CD4 activation markers upon ex-vivo coculture with dissociated KPC tumors. We therefore hypothesize that apCAFs are required for the ICI-mediated anti-tumor effect and do so via modulation of CD4 T cell responses. Although a small proportion of the total compartment, the apCAF subset may be enhanced in number and function by CAF-targeted modulators to synergize with ICI to affect the antitumor response, which could provide a solution to the currently unmet need for new and more effective treatments for PDAC patients.\n Citation Format: Saumya Maru, Kathryn Howe, Lalitya Andaloori, James Leatherman, Joseph Tandurella, Edward J.

These observations suggest that TILs may be general markers of patient outcomes, but evidence in support of this hypothesis has been limited by small cohorts.\n We validated ImmunoPROFILE, a multiplexed immunofluorescence (MIF)-based assay coupled with machine-learning-based image analysis, to identify and quantify tumor cells (cytokeratin, PAX5, PAX8, SOX10), T cells (CD8), T-regulatory cells (FOXP3), exhausted cells (PD-1) and immunosuppressive tumor and immune cells (PD-L1). We applied the MIF panel to specimens from patients collected prospectively over three years and analyzed 2,023 cases across 27 tumor types. The association between biomarkers and overall survival (OS) was investigated using Cox models controlling for patient risk factors such as cancer type, metastatic vs. primary disease, age, and gender. Multivariable biomarker selection was based on likelihood ratios.\n The assay was highly robust (success rate 97%), reproducible (inter-scanning and intra-staining density controls within 1 SD, inter-staining PD-L1 scores ≤11% CV), and operator-independent (R2 >0.7 to >0.9 for each biomarker and 95% concordance in PD-L1 score-based interpretation between technicians). From whole slide images, a total of 11,932 individual regions of interest were analyzed across the cohort, resulting in >50 million spatially-resolved single cells which were summarized into cell population densities and PD-L1 scores.\n High densities of CD8+ (>64/mm2, p<0.0001), PD-1+ (>50/mm2, p<0.0001), and FOXP3+ (>30/mm2, p<0.0001) T cells were associated with longer overall survival (OS) irrespective of therapy and across all cancer types. PD-L1 metrics were not associated with OS (p=0.43). Compared to patients with low densities of CD8+ and PD-1+ cells, high densities of at least one of these cell types had better OS (Both high, HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.59; CD8+ high, HR: 0.63, (0.48 - 0.82); PD-1+ high, HR: 0.71, (0.54 - 0.93)). The results were consistent in the subset of patients (N=1572) who did not receive immunotherapy (IO). In patients who received IO therapy (N=451), only PD-1+ T-cell density associated with OS (HR: 0.48, (0.36 - 0.65)).\n To our knowledge, this is the first enterprise-level immune biomarker assay using multiplexed staining, digital imaging, and machine learning to be applied in a prospective manner to clinical specimens at scale. We found that select immune cell densities are prognostic across cancer types and therapies and demonstrated that quantification of multiple cell populations yields better prognostic power than single marker analyses.\n Citation Format: James Lindsay, Bijaya Sharma, Kristen D.

Anlotinib is an oral multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that strongly inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit. Preclinical studies showed that metronomic chemotherapy inhibited angiogenesis and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy in TNBC via modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. We hereby conducted a single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus anlotinib and metronomic chemotherapy as a potential novel therapeutic strategy in advanced TNBC and explore potential biomarkers. Methods: Forty-four cases were planning to be included in this trial. The eligible patients who had received no more than two lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were enrolled and received sintilimab (200 mg iv q3w) and anlotinib (12 mg po d1-14 q3w) plus capecitabine (500 mg po, tid) or vinorelbine (40 mg po, tiw) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The safety profile has also been assessed. Results: As of April 2023, a total of 44 patients were enrolled, and 42 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 3 patients (7.1%) achieved complete response (CR). 6 patients (14.3%) achieved partial response (PR). 25 patients (59.5%) achieved stable disease (SD).The ORR is 21.4% (95%CI 0.103-0.368) and DCR is 81.0% (95%CI 0.810-0.659). The median PFS was 5.06 months (95%CI 2.051-8.069). The most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events (AEs) include elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (52.38%, 22/42), elevated bilirubin (23.81%, 10/42), hand-foot syndrome (22.22%, 8/42), leukopenia (16.67%,7/42), nausea (14.29%, 6/42). Grade 3 AEs include elevated bilirubin (2.38%, 1/42), hypertension (2.38%, 1/42) and herpes zoster (2.38%, 1/42). No grade 4 or 5 AEs occurred.

    "abstract" : "Background and Objective Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype, historically managed with chemotherapy regimens predominantly involving anthracyclines and taxanes, yielding unfavorable prognoses. This review endeavors to offer a thorough examination of the present state of treatment strategies for early stage triple negative breast cancer (eTNBC), with a particular emphasis on immunotherapy modalities, combination therapies, predictive biomarkers, and ongoing clinical trials. The principal aim of this review is to meticulously assess the available literature, ascertain significant discoveries, and engage in discussions regarding their potential implications for future research endeavors, clinical applications, and policy formulation. Methods This review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, with the latest update performed in March 2023. The search strategy was designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the literature, with a focus on recent advancements. Key Content and Findings We critically assess the current eTNBC treatment landscape, covering efficacy and limitations of monotherapy, combination therapies, and predictive biomarkers. We highlight promising results from recent trials, address controversies surrounding chemotherapy, and explore optimal approaches for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Insights into personalized treatment strategies, ongoing trials, and future perspectives are provided, advancing our understanding of therapeutic options for eTNBC. Conclusions Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, this review highlights the potential of immunotherapy, particularly in combination with chemotherapy, as a promising approach for treating eTNBC. However, further research is warranted to optimize treatment strategies, refine patient selection criteria, and identify reliable biomarkers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The findings of this review hold significant implications for future research, clinical practice, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the current challenges and advancements in eTNBC treatment. Ultimately, this knowledge can contribute to improved patient outcomes, enhanced quality of life, and the development of more effective therapeutic approaches for eTNBC."

    "abstract" : "Purpose Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) has a high incidence rate, and economic burdens to patients, healthcare systems, and societies. Durvalumab plus tremelimumab and chemotherapy (T+D+CT) is a novel therapeutic strategy for mNSCLC, which demonstrated promising efficacy in a phase-3 randomized clinical trial, but its economic value remains unclear. Methods This economic evaluation used a hypothetical cohort of patients with mNSCLC, with characteristics mirroring those of the participants in the POSEIDON trial. Several partitioned survival models were constructed to estimate 15-year costs and health outcomes associated with the T+D+CT, durvalumab plus chemotherapy (D+CT) and chemotherapy alone (CT) strategies, discounting costs and effectiveness at 3% annually. Costs were in 2023 US dollars. Data were derived from the POSEIDON trial and published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of input parameters and study generalizability. The analysis was designed and conducted from September 2022 to March 2023. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of T+D+CT, compared with CT and D+CT, for mNSCLC from the perspectives of the US healthcare sector and society. Findings From the healthcare sector’s perspective, the T+D+CT yielded an additional 0.09 QALYs at an increased cost of $7,108 compared with CT, which resulted in an ICER of $82,501/QALY. The T+D+CT strategy yielded an additional 0.02 QALYs at an increased cost of $27,779 compared with the D+CT, which resulted in an ICER of $1,243,868/QALY. The economic results of T+D+CT vs. CT were most sensitive to the annual discount rate, subsequent immunotherapy cost, tremelimumab cost, palliative care and death cost, pemetrexed cost, and durvalumab cost. The T+D+CT strategy was considered cost-effective relative to CT in 59%–82% of model iterations against willingness-to-pay. thresholds of $100,000/QALY gained to $150,000/QALY gained. From the societal perspective, the T+D+CT can be considered as cost-effective as compared with CT or D+CT, independent of histology. Implications In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the T+D+CT strategy represented good value compared with CT for patients with mNSCLC from the perspectives of the healthcare sector and the society. This treatment strategy may be prioritized for mNSCLC patients at high risks of disease progression."

Immunosuppression is an established risk factor for developing MCC, but IC patients have typically been excluded from clinical trials of immunotherapies. We report an analysis of clinical characteristics, survival outcomes, and safety in IC and non-IC patients with MCC treated with avelumab in routine clinical practice in Germany.\n Methods:\n This prospective, noninterventional, multicenter, dynamic cohort study (MCC-TRIM; EUPAS25338) enrolled patients with MCC in Germany between April 2019 and September 2023. Primary data from a study-specific electronic case report form and secondary data from the German national skin cancer registry were combined. For this analysis, avelumab-treated patients were grouped as IC or non-IC based on prespecified comorbid conditions and concomitant medications. Survival outcomes with first-line avelumab treatment were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n Results:\n Among 875 patients with MCC (various disease stages) enrolled in the study, 243 were treated with avelumab, of whom 189 (77.8%) were considered non-IC and 54 (22.2%) were considered IC. Patient characteristics are summarized in the Table. At data cutoff (March 2024), median follow-up (IQR) was 14.3 months (6.4-29.4) in the non-IC subgroup and 8.9 (4.2-22.8) in the IC subgroup. In non-IC and IC subgroups, median (95% CI) overall survival from start of first-line avelumab was 38.2 (15.7-not estimable) and 9.9 (4.8-29.8) months, and median progression-free survival was 7.9 (4.0-11.6) and 4.3 (1.0-7.8) months, respectively. The incidence rate of ADRs related to avelumab was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.75-1.34) events per person-year in the non-IC subgroup and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.32-1.45) events per person-year in the IC subgroup.\n Conclusions:\n Results from this German nationwide registry showed the safe and effective use of avelumab in routine clinical practice for IC and non-IC patients with MCC.\n \n \n \n \n \n Non-IC (n=189)\n IC (n=54)\n \n \n \n \n Mean age at diagnosis (SD), years\n 74.8 (10.2)\n 76.4 (8.1)\n \n \n Male, n (%)\n 122 (64.6)\n 35 (64.8)\n \n \n Stage at diagnosis, n (%) Early stage (I, II, or unknown) III IV\n 38 (20.1)80 (42.3)71 (37.6)\n 13 (24.1)19 (35.2)22 (40.7)\n \n \n ECOG performance status ≤1, n (%)\n 153 (81.0)\n 40 (74.0)\n \n \n Comorbidities, n (%) Diabetes Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Cerebrovascular disease/stroke Moderate or severe renal disease Ischemic heart disease/myocardial infarction Moderate or severe liver disease Thyroid disorder Inflammatory bowel disease Rheumatoid arthritis\n 36 (19.0)5 (2.6)2 (1.1)11 (5.8)21 (11.1)3 (1.6)17 (9.0)4 (2.1)5 (2.6)\n 14 (25.9)4 (7.4)3 (5.6)5 (9.3)8 (14.8)04 (7.4)2 (3.7)5 (9.3)\n \n \n \n \n"

    "abstract" : "\n CD8+ T cells are indispensable for pathogen and tumor clearance, although can induce immunopathology if left unrestricted. T cell exhaustion, progressively programmed in the context of persistent antigen exposure, ensures partial control while mitigating immunopathological risk. However, exhaustion is characterized by curtailed proliferative capacity, cytokine production and cytotoxic functions, which tumors and chronic pathogens exploit to persist. As such, transiently disrupting exhaustion has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. Exhausted cells transition through a range of differentiation states, from stem-like progenitors that mediate response to checkpoint blockade, through to terminal effector or exhausted cells. Understanding the molecular pathways moderating the exhausted states and promoting terminal exhaustion is essential for augmenting cancer immunotherapy. We identify IKZF transcription factors, Ikaros (IKZF1), Helios (IKZF2) and Aiolos (IKZF3), as key mediators of T cell exhaustion, using gene knock-out mice and a CRISPR-mediated genetic knock-out system in both chronic infection and tumor models. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are critical regulators of exhausted subset expansion, retention, phenotype and cytokine function. Strikingly, dual IKZF1 and IKZF3 ablation boosts the response of anti-tumor and anti-viral exhausted T cells, potentially via the formation of atypical exhausted T cell populations and the enrichment of functional exhausted subsets. Cumulatively, our data highlight a novel role for IKZF transcription factors in biasing exhausted T cell differentiation and provides potentially important clinical implications, directing future cancer immunotherapies targeting T cell exhaustion.\n Citation Format: Sinead M Reading, Isabelle Munoz, Maria Nogueira de Menezes, Nicole Y.L Saw, Krutika Ambani, Antonio Ahn, Simone Nussing, Sara Roth, Shienny Sampurno, Kelly M Ramsbottom, Joseph A Trapani, Kim L Good-Jacobson, Ricky W Johnstone, Shom Goel, Paul A Beavis, Ian A Parish.

Numerous clinical studies have sought to optimize this treatment paradigm to enhance clinical outcomes. In this retrospective real-world study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the addition of induction chemoimmunotherapy prior to the PACIFIC regimen compared with the standard PACIFIC regimen. The aim was to determine whether introducing immunotherapy earlier into the treatment strategy for unresectable stage III NSCLC could improve disease control rates.\n Methods:\n This study included patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Patients received either induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by cCRT or sequential chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) with consolidation immunotherapy, or cCRT/sCRT directly followed by consolidation immunotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the initiation of consolidation immunotherapy to disease progression or death. The incidence of radiation-induced immune pneumonitis was also assessed between the two groups.\n Results:\n A total of 210 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were included in this study, enrolled between July 2019 and April 2023. Among them, 76 patients received induction chemoimmunotherapy, and 134 patients were treated without induction chemoimmunotherapy. Baseline characteristics between the two groups showed no significant differences. The proportion of patients receiving cCRT in the induction chemoimmunotherapy group and the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group was 29/76 (38.1%) and 110/134 (82.1%), respectively. Within each group, there was no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients treated with cCRT or sCRT. The induction chemoimmunotherapy group demonstrated superior median PFS (mPFS) compared to the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group (not reached vs. 17.2 months, P=0.01). Overall survival (OS) data remain immature for analysis. The incidence of pneumonitis was observed in 52/76 (68.4%) patients in the induction chemoimmunotherapy group, with ≥Grade 2 pneumonitis occurring in 18/76 (23.7%) patients. In the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group, pneumonitis occurred in 86/134 (64.2%) patients, with ≥Grade 2 pneumonitis in 30/134 (22.4%) patients. No significant differences in pneumonitis incidence or severity were observed between the two groups.\n Conclusions:\n The addition of induction chemoimmunotherapy prior to the PACIFIC regimen demonstrated improved disease control rates compared to the standard approach, with no increased risk of pneumonitis.\n"

    "abstract" : "\n Cystatin C (CyC) is a secreted cysteine protease inhibitor that is commonly used as a marker of renal function, and whose biological functions remain insufficiently characterized. Plasma CyC is elevated relative to renal function in many patients, including those receiving glucocorticoid (GC) treatment and patients with cancer. Endogenous GCs are essential for life and are appropriately upregulated in response to systemic stress. Here we empirically connect GCs with the systemic regulation of CyC. Using measurements of CyC and creatinine, another established marker of renal function, we used genome-wide association and structural equation modeling to determine the genetics of the latent trait CyC production in UK Biobank, thereby uncoupling CyC from renal function. CyC production and a polygenic score (PGS) capturing germline predisposition to CyC production predicted elevated all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Using phenome-wide association, we further identified an association between germline predisposition to CyC production and accelerated onset of metabolic syndrome. As a potential explanation for these associations, we provide multiple lines of evidence that CyC is a direct transcriptional target of GC receptor, with GC-responsive CyC secretion exhibited by macrophages (cf. monocytes) and co-opted by multiple cancer cell lines, potentially explaining selective CyC elevations in disease states. Using isogenic CyC-knockout tumors (CRISPR-Cas9), we discovered a markedly attenuated tumor growth in vivo that was associated with a significantly reduced fraction of non-epithelial cells. To investigate whether depletion of specific non-epithelial cells could explain this, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing, which revealed abrogated recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages in knockout tumors, subsequently validated by Trem2 immunohistochemistry in a non-overlapping cohort. Trem2+ macrophages have previously been linked to immune suppression and failure of cancer immunotherapy. Consistent with this, we show that the CyC production PGS predicted checkpoint immunotherapy failure in a combined clinical trial cohort of 685 metastatic cancer patients. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CyC may be a direct effector of GC-induced immunosuppression, acting through the recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages, and therefore could be a target for combination cancer immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Sam O.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) can potentially cure hematologic malignancies through graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). Several studies have suggested that IFN-γ pathway is critical for GVL sensitivity or resistance in leukemia cells. In mouse model, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generated in IFN-γ receptor-deficient mice acquired resistance to GVL (Matte-Martone, Shlomchik WD, J Clin Invest. 2017). Other groups have reported that IFN-γ restores HLA expression on myeloid blasts from patients who relapsed AMLs after alloSCT. These data support the clinical application of IFN-γ to augment GVL in subjects with post-transplant relapse. However, AML is molecularly heterogeneous, and the IFN-γ responsiveness may vary by AML subtypes. We analyzed IFN-γ responsiveness of primary AML cells and investigated the role of IFN-γ on cell death and T-cell recognition of AML cell lines.\n Methods: Primary AML cells collected at diagnosis (n=60), at relapse after chemotherapy (n=4), and at post-transplant relapse (n=8) were stimulated with IFN-γ at 1 ng/ml or 50 ng/mL in vitro, and IFN-γ responsiveness was analyzed by measuring phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT) after 15 minutes and upregulation of HLA-DR after 48 hours by flow cytometry. U937 and THP-1 cell lines were used to investigate IFN-γ induced cell death and the impact of IFN-γ priming of leukemia cells on the activation of alloreactive T cells. For this, Jurkat cells transduced with anti-HA1 T cell receptor (αHA1-TCR-T) were used, and the activation was analyzed through CD69 upregulation by flow cytometry.\n Results: IFN-γ responsiveness was heterogeneous in both pSTAT1 and HLA-DR upregulation of primary AML blasts. IFN-γ responsiveness also varied within the subpopulation of leukemic blasts within the sample at diagnosis and relapse, implying clonal evolution. Compared to THP-1, U937 cells fail to upregulate HLA-DR with IFN-γ despite appropriate pSTAT1 response to IFN-γ, suggesting silencing of downstream IFN-γ activation site (GAS) and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN-γ directly induced cell death in THP-1 in vitro, while U937 was resistant to IFN-γ induced cell death. Priming of THP-1 with IFN-γ significantly improved the affinity of αHA1-TCR-T to peptide-stimulated THP-1.\n Conclusion: IFN-γ responsiveness of AML blasts was heterogeneous, and cell line data suggest an impact of IFN-γ sensitivity on IFN-γ mediated cell death and alloreactive T cell recognition. Future studies aim to understand the mechanisms underlying IFN-γ sensitivity or resistance in AML, which would help to design clinical trials by selecting the patients who would obtain maximal benefit from IFN-γ therapy in post-transplant relapse (NCT04628338).\n Citation Format: Kedwin Ventura, Iuliia Kovalenko, Jui-En Ray Lee, Biswas Neupane, Daniel Stapor, Sawa Ito.

There are limited randomized data for age-appropriate Rx in older mUC adults. Through our real-world study, we describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes among pts with mUC, comparing older to younger adults receiving 1L systemic Rx. Methods: This retrospective IRB-approved study included pts receiving care between 2014 and 2023 at the University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, a tertiary care National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Eligible pts had a confirmed diagnosis of mUC and received 1L chemotherapy or 1L immunotherapy-based regimens. Based on age at receipt of 1L Rx, pts aged 70 years or above were grouped in the ‘older’ group, while rest were included in the ‘younger’ cohort. Survival and Rx-related outcomes of those enrolled inwere excluded. Overall survival (OS) between the two groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression analysis. All statistical analyses were implemented in R-Studio (v.4.2). Results: We identified 212 eligible mUC pts (103 older vs. 109 younger). Older pts received more immunotherapy-based Rx in the 1L (52.4% vs 35.7%, p=0.02), were more likely to be (73.6% vs. 45.4%, p<0.001), less likely to receive subsequent lines of Rx (median; range: 0 (0-3) vs 1 (0-5), p=0.005) and had lower clinical trial participation (69.9% vs 81.6%, p=0.04)compared to younger pts. For survival outcomes and treatment-related analysis, 160 patients (72 older vs. 88 younger) undergoing approved standard of care were included. Among mUC treated with 1L chemotherapy (n=108), more pts required dose adjustments in older group (23/43 vs 15/65 younger). Older adults received less number of cycles of chemotherapy (median; range: 4 (0-6) vs 5 (1-12), p= 0.03). Older pts had OS comparable to younger pts (11.2 mos vs. 14 mos, p=0.06). Pts from both age groups had similar rates of Rx-related toxicity and healthcare visits, independent of the type of systemic Rx. Conclusions: Older pts with mUC tend to be cis-ineligible and have lower bone marrow reserve. Nevertheless, select pts can be treated with risk-adjusted regimens of chemotherapy and with immunotherapy with comparable outcomes to younger mUC pts in terms of toxicity and outcomes. Validated tools to predict vulnerabilities and excessive chemotherapy-related toxicity in older adults with mUC are available and may help mitigate toxicity by informing Rx adjustments."

Tumor-derived sequence mutations and plasma aneuploidy were tracked longitudinally using a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach and combined to evaluate changes in total cell-free tumor load (cfTL). Dynamic changes in cfTL were monitored for each patient to determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular response during therapy.\n Results: Longitudinal assessment of cfTL dynamics allowed for the evaluation of molecular response in all patients studied. Overall, 9 patients were classified as molecular responders based on sustained complete elimination of cfTL. For 14 patients, we observed initial molecular responses, followed by cfTL recrudescence. In a subset of 10 patients we observed a distinct pattern of molecular progression characterized by cfTL persistence across all timepoints analyzed. Patients with sustained molecular responses attained longer overall (OS; log-rank p=0.0006) and progression-free (PFS; log-rank p<0.0001) survival, with molecular responses detected on average 4 weeks earlier than imaging. Importantly, ctDNA molecular response remained the most significant predictor of OS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.09, 95% CI=0.02-0.42, p=0.002; molecular response f/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.14, 95% CI=0.04-0.48, p=0.002) and PFS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.02, 95% CI=0.00-0.16, p<0.001; molecular response f/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.05, 95% CI=0.01-0.26, p<0.001) after adjustment for clinical covariates in a multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model. Analysis of landmark OS and PFS endpoints revealed that molecular responses more accurately predicted OS at 12 (AUC 78.1% vs 73.3%) and 64 months (AUC 87.3% vs 67.6%) and PFS at 3 (AUC 91.7% vs 82.0%) and 12 months (AUC 83.5% vs 78.8%) compared to conventional imaging.\n Conclusions: Longitudinal tracking of sequence and structural ctDNA features provide an accurate and rapid approach to track changes in tumor burden and prognosticate outcomes during systemic therapy in patients with SCLC. These findings suggest that therapeutic response monitoring based on combined molecular response criteria may be used to provide guidance on clinical decision making for patients with SCLC.\n Citation Format: Lavanya Sivapalan, Wade T.

The GARNET trial showed that mechanism of MMR loss did not influence response of EC to monotherapy with dostarlimab (DOST), an anti-PD-1. No data exist examining OS by mechanism of MMR loss in patients (pts) with EC receiving immunotherapy. Here, we report analyses of PFS and OS in pts with primary advanced or recurrent EC (pA/rEC) in Part 1 of the RUBY trial (NCT03981796) by mechanism of MMR protein loss. Methods: Pts with pA/rEC were randomized 1:1 to receive DOST or placebo (PBO), plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP), followed by DOST or PBO monotherapy for up to 3 years. MMR protein status was assessed by immunohistochemistry. MMR loss of function gene mutations were determined by Personalis ImmunoID NeXT whole-exome sequencing assay. MMR protein loss without mutations in MMR genes was a surrogate indicator for epi-dMMR. Post hoc PFS and OS analyses utilized data from the data cut at which each endpoint was met (PFS at Sep 28, 2022; OS at Sep 22, 2023). Results: Part 1 of the RUBY trial included 118 pts with dMMR/MSI-H pA/rEC (DOST+CP = 53; PBO+CP = 65); 39 pts (73.6%) in the DOST+CP arm and 52 pts (80.0%) in the PBO+CP arm had MMR gene mutation data available. Substantial PFS and OS benefits were observed with DOST+CP vs PBO+CP in pts with mut-dMMR or epi-dMMR (Table). No significant differences were seen in PFS or OS in pts with mut-dMMR vs pts with epi-dMMR. Conclusions: DOST+CP led to substantial PFS and OS benefits compared with PBO+CP indMMR/MSI-H pA/rEC, regardless of mechanism of MMR protein loss. A limited number of pts with mut-dMMR treated with DOST+CP were available for analysis; however, the results support that mechanism of MMR loss does not appear to be a significant predictor of clinical benefit for dostarlimab treatment in pts with dMMR pA/rEC in Part 1 of the RUBY trial.

    "abstract" : "Cancer poses a significant challenge to human health due to its complex biological systems, necessitating in-depth analysis. Single-cell sequencing has become an essential tool for investigating these systems, enabling the detection of gene expression and epigenetic modifications at the single-cell level. To elucidate research trends, collaboration networks, and knowledge dissemination in this field, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database, covering publications from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023. The Bibliometrix package in R was used to extract and analyze key publication data, including document types, countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. Additionally, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology were employed for data compilation and visualization. The analysis identified 34,074 authors from 3,129 institutions across 75 countries and regions, contributing to 5,680 publications on single-cell sequencing in cancer, published in 788 academic journals. China and the United States emerged as the leading nations in publication volume. Harvard University produced the highest number of publications (320), with Aviv Regev, affiliated with Harvard, recognized as a key contributor. Leading journals, such as Frontiers in Immunology and Nature Communications, highlight both established and emerging research areas, including the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy. Key trends and potential areas for future research include intra-tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and drug delivery systems. This study provides a comprehensive overview of single-cell sequencing research in oncology, emphasizing its rapid progress, driven by technological advancements and international collaborations. Strengthening global partnerships, developing integrative analytical tools, and addressing data complexities will be crucial for advancing personalized cancer therapies and deepening insights into cancer biology."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they are often associated with severe immune related adverse events (irAEs). These severe irAEs are more often seen in patients with obesity or concomitantly treated with cytotoxic therapies.\n Methods: We aimed to understand the mechanisms of ICB-induced irAEs, in the context of obesity and ICB/chemotherapy combinations. We developed a mouse model of cardiac irAEs, which is the most fatal type of irAE in ICB-treated cancer patients, with clinically relevant features: (i) an ICB-resistant cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or PDAC), (ii) obesity induced with high-fat diets, and (iii) a combination treatment of ICB (α-PD1 + α-CTLA4) and chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX).\n Results: Our FDA and single institution retrospective analyses indicate that patients treated with ICB had greater relative risk of developing myocarditis as compared to other anti-cancer therapies. Mice with orthotopic PDAC and obesity developed irAEs after treatment with ICB and chemotherapy as compared to chow diet. These irAEs recapitulated those observed in patients with cancer and obesity, including cardiac dysfunction consistent with myocarditis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased circulating levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b). IL-1β blockade prevented myocarditis and reduced cardiac fibrosis after immunotherapy. Importantly, IL-1β blockade also enhanced the anti-tumor effects of ICB + FOLFIRINOX combination therapy, and increased mouse survival.\n Conclusions: We developed a translationally relevant 'triple hit' mouse model and discovered that IL-1β mediates ICB-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, we found that IL-1β blockers, which are already used in the clinic for cardiology indications, both reduce adverse events and simultaneously enhance the antitumor effects triggered by immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Nilesh P.

    "abstract" : "TPS5624 Background: Camrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, specifically targets PD-1 to inhibit its interaction with PD-L1, thereby reactivating the T cell immune response against tumors. The NACI study demonstrated that, in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, the combination of camrelizumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%. Specifically, complete remission was observed in 4 patients (8.33%), while 44 patients (91.67%) experienced partial remission. This regimen significantly outperformed traditional treatments in efficacy, with manageable toxicity levels. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC) is a highly rare and aggressive malignancy characterized by its distinctive biological behavior, propensity for early lymph node and hematogenous metastasis, and limited effective treatment options, leading to a dismal prognosis. Although PD-1 inhibitors have shown promise in some NECC case reports, there is a notable absence of comprehensive, prospective clinical trials to substantiate their effectiveness. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with NECC. Methods: This open-label, single-arm, prospective phase II study evaluates the antitumor efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with etoposide and cisplatin in roughly 30 patients with NECC. Eligible participants are aged 18-75, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, and histologically confirmed NECC, specifically targeting small cell and large cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma but excluding atypical and typical carcinoid tumors. Inclusion criteria stipulate that if NECC is present alongside other tumor types, the neuroendocrine carcinoma component must account for more than 60% of the tumor mass. The treatment protocol involves neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, comprising two to three cycles of camrelizumab (200 mg, IV, day 1), cisplatin (75 mg/m², IV, day 1), and etoposide (100 mg/m², IV, days 1-3) administered every three weeks. Following this, patients achieving complete or partial response will proceed to radical surgery and adjuvant therapy, while those with stable or progressive disease, or considered unsuitable for surgery by gynecological oncologists, will transfer to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary objective is to ascertain the objective response rate as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary objectives include disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and evaluations of safety and tolerability. The study began on December 28, 2023, with ongoing enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT05910177 ."

This study aimed to compare short-term outcomes between MIG after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (NICT-MIG) and MIG after neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (NCT-MIG), and determine risk factors for post-operative complications (POCs). Methods This retrospective study included clinicopathologic data from 193 patients who underwent NCT-MIG or NICT-MIG between January 2020 and February 2023 in the Department of General Surgery, Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital First Medical Center (Beijing, China). Propensity score-matched analysis at a ratio of 1:2 was performed to reduce bias from confounding patient-related variables and short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results The baseline characteristics were comparable between 49 patients in the NICT-MIG group and 86 patients in the NCT-MIG group after propensity score matching. Objective and pathologic complete response rates were significantly higher in the NICT-MIG group than in the NCT-MIG group (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of treat-related adverse events, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, number of retrieved lymph nodes, time to the first flatus, post-operative duration of hospitalization, overall morbidity, and severe morbidity were comparable between the NCT-MIG and NICT-MIG groups (P > 0.05). By multivariate logistic analysis, estimated blood loss of >200 mL (P = 0.010) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score of <45 (P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for POCs after MIG following neoadjuvant therapy. Conclusions Safety and feasibility of NICT were comparable to those of NCT in patients undergoing MIG for LAGC. Patients with an estimated blood loss of >200 mL or a PNI score of <45 should be carefully evaluated for increased POCs risk."

    "abstract" : "Background: Several studies have proven the relationship between PD-L1, which is known as an immunotherapy target, and poor prognosis. The presence of a tumor budding (TB) group tumor outside the main tumor is also associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between PD-L1 and the grade of TB in cervical carcinoma. Methods: The design of this research is a case-control study with a retrospective approach. The sample is from a paraffin block of the primary cervical cancer tumor from the results of surgery in Balimed Denpasar Hospital between 2020 and 2023. From the statistical formula for the case-control study, a minimum sample of 15 is obtained for the case group with the criteria of high-grade TB, while 15 people were in the control group with low-grade TB. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) PD-L1 is positive if the membrane or cytoplasm is brown, and is negative if there is no brown color on the membrane or cytoplasm. Inferential statistics were used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 overexpression and low- and high-grade TB in cervical carcinoma using a chi-square test. Results: The results of this research revealed (p = 0.273) that there was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and high- and low-grade TB. Overexpression of PD-L1 was associated with a 2.250-fold increased risk of high-grade TB (OR = 2.250 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.103–1.915). Conclusions: The severity of TB does not correlate with PD-L1 expression. The functions of PD-L1 and other variables in the carcinogenesis of TB development are the cause of this weak association."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction and Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 12% of breast cancers (BC) in the US and 15% worldwide. It lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Compared to other types of BC, it is more aggressive and has higher risks of recurrence. In the metastatic setting, survival outcomes are much worse than other BC subtypes, with a 5-years survival rate of 8-16%. There is an urgent need to develop better treatment options for TNBC patients. We have developed a novel therapeutic, QN-247, by conjugating an anti-proliferative DNA aptamer to gold nanospheres. The aptamer-gold nanosphere construct shows increased half-life and cytotoxic effects relative to the aptamer alone. QN-247 inhibits nucleolin, a key regulatory protein overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, thereby reducing their proliferation.\n Description of Experimental Procedures: A subcutaneous, TNBC model (MDA-MB-231 xenograft) in nude mice was used in this efficacy study. When tumor volumes reached sufficient size (85 mm3), QN-247 test compound, aptamer alone, and vehicle control was administered daily (QD) at 1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 12 days. Tumor volumes and body weights were measured regularly through day 20. Nine animals were included in each treatment group. Summary of DataA statistically significant reduction in mean tumor volumes of QN-247 treated mice compared to the vehicle control and aptamer alone was observed. Tolerability of the QN-247 treatment was excellent with no evidence of toxicity.\n Statement of Conclusions: This study demonstrates that QN-247 exerts a powerful anti-tumor effect. Additional preclinical mouse xenograft tumor models will be treated with QN-247 to study its effect on other cancers.\n Citation Format: Tariq Arshad, Stephen Fait, Guy Gammon, Andrew Hertig, Mark J.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Community Engagement and the All of Us Research Program. Community engagement is a proven and effective tool to enhance participation in research by increasing access and awareness of medical studies. Increasing access and awareness of medical studies with an emphasis on populations who have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) has also shown to expand the reach of innovative and novel breakthrough therapies in early detection to improve cancer outcomes. To ensure that advances in early detection improve cancer health inequities for all, early engagement has been demonstrated to be critical. Early and ongoing engagement has been at the core of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All of Us Research Program. All of Us adheres to the community engagement principles of information-sharing, consultation, involvement and collaboration in decision-making, and empowered action in informal groups or through formal partnerships. Since its inception in 2015, the overarching goal of the All of Us community engagement strategy has been to create a program that reflects the needs, preferences, and priorities of individuals in the U.S. inclusive of UBR communities. As such, program participants and partners have been involved in all aspects of the program including governance, oversight, design, conduct, dissemination, and evaluation. All of Us has accomplished unprecedented advances in the inclusion of UBR populations by building the largest, most diverse biomedical resource of its kind: 80% of program participants are from UBR communities covering a broad range of age, social, racial, ethnic, cultural, geographical, and health statuses. Additionally, nearly 50% of participants self-identify as racial and ethnic minorities. This inclusion of diverse communities throughout the program moves us closer to achieving health equity in biomedical research and ensuring more precise care for all.\n The Role of Early Community Engagement in Mitigating Cancer Disparities. Our ability to have a diverse participant pool is due in large part to intentional and early community engagement efforts together with the creation of an ecosystem built to support community partners. Research shows that community engagement can help mitigate cancer health disparities by increasing communities’ knowledge of the importance of healthy behaviors such as screening, awareness of research, building trust in research, and improving study design and ethics. All of this combined with groundbreaking progress in early cancer detection and available therapies has the potential to transform patient care. Immunotherapy and gene therapy, a better understanding of fertility preservation in cancer treatment, and how artificial intelligence (AI) models can predict patients’ risks of breast cancer are only a few recent and transformative advances that are driving progress against cancer. While these and other advances are promising, many UBR communities have not benefited equally from this progress. Historical, systemic, and structural barriers, such as the digital divide and lack of access to and awareness of clinical trials, are preventing the achievement of equitable advances in precision medicine and cancer research. Early and intentional community engagement efforts must be put in place to ensure that these innovative advances reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer prevention and detection in medically underserved groups. For instance, we must consider the role that \"ZNA\" (zip code or neighborhood association) or \"place and space\" has on cancer. We know that ZNA can be just as important in the precision medicine and cancer journey as someone’s DNA. Research has not always been conducted in places where the populations reflect the diversity of the U.S. Most cancer oncology trials and cancer treatment centers may not be accessible to those that carry the greatest burden of disease, which leads to greater disparities. Similarly, researchers play an essential role in community engagement; studies have shown that being engaged by a research team that reflects the diversity of the population being studied leads to greater participation in research, better retention, and adherence to recommendations.\n Conclusion: These are only a few reasons why engaging UBR communities in the early phases and throughout the duration of research studies is important to identify the right problems, formulate the appropriate questions, and build mutual trust and transparency. Redefining participants’ roles not as “patients” or “subjects” but as true partners will improve health outcomes and better address health care for all, leading us to a future where precision engagement drives research along with rigorous science and where community engagement ensures equity and inclusion in precision medicine for all.\n Objectives: This presentation will (a) describe how early engagement can lead to mitigation of cancer disparities, (b) discuss best practices of early and intentional community engagement, (c) outline the All of Us engagement ecosystem, and (d) explore the future of engagement in building sustainable, cohesive, and equitable communities.\n Citation Format: Karriem S.

The current standard therapy for patients with CRC includes neoadjuvant therapies combined with surgery, often resulting in severe complications that affect patients’ lifestyles. Hence, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of the tumor microenvironment to improve the current therapeutics for metastatic CRC. We characterized T cell dynamics in response to tumors at early (1-2 weeks) versus late stages (6-7 weeks) of CRC development in different colon compartments (tumor, epithelium, lamina propria), as well as in colon-draining lymph nodes and the liver as potential metastasis sites. To achieve this, we injected by colonoscopy tumor AKP mouse organoids (mutations in APC, Kras, and P53 genes) or metastatic AKP mouse organoids in the colon walls of a novel fate-mapping strain (iSell-tomato). This model allows for the labelling of peripheral T cells that are recruited to the tissue or tumor sites. Our initial data showed an enhanced recruitment of CD4 and CD8ab T cells to the colon epithelium in early stage AKP (non-metastatic) tumor models compared to late-stage AKP and metastatic-AKP models at both stages. These recruited cells exhibited an enhanced anti-tumorigenic profile characterized by the production of IFNg and reduced frequency of FoxP3+ CD4 regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, T cells recruited to early stage metastatic-AKP tumors and late-stage tumors of the colon and liver exhibited enhanced exhaustion characterized by an increased frequency of PD1+ CD4 and CD8ab T cells. These data suggest a time- and aggressiveness-dependent effect of tumors on immune cell infiltrates that, in turn, affect tumor progression and metastasis.\n Citation Format: Marwa A Saad, Angelina Bilate, Daniel Mucida.

    "abstract" : "\n Glioblastoma (GBM), a challenging brain tumor, necessitates the development of new therapies due to poor patient prognoses, with a median survival of 14-16 months. Standard of care, as established almost 20 years ago, remains to be surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation and till date there is no defined standard of care for recurrent GBM, highlighting the urgent need for the development of novel therapies. Recent studies have implicated the tumor microenvironment in these poor prognoses. While cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a key cellular component of the microenvironment of many systemic tumors, their presence in GBM had been doubted until we recently developed intriguing data identifying cells in GBM that express fibroblast markers, have fibroblast-like morphology, and, most importantly, transcriptomically resemble CAFs from systemic cancers rather than other stromal cells that express similar surface markers such as pericytes (Jain et al. 2023). Similar to other solid cancers, GBM CAFs increase tumor growth and drive immunosuppression. The role of CAFs in regulating these processes could have significant implications in response to standard of care therapy as well as novel immunotherapies. While our initial CAF isolation had just 50% purity, we have developed a novel flow-sorting algorithm for CAF enrichment driven by our bioinformatic data. Through this protocol, we have successfully established, the first of its kind, a biobank of patient derived GBM CAFs with greater than 90% purity. These CAFs are now being utilized to investigate their contribution in conferring resistance to chemotherapy (Temozolomide) and radiotherapy. The CAFs are also being assessed for their role in suppressing T cell function and resistance to immunotherapies. In parallel, the origin of GBM CAFs and their development trajectory is being analyzed to find molecular markers to specifically target CAFs in the GBM microenvironment. The work put together will provide insight on mechanisms employed by CAFs in altering the GBM microenvironment and a basis for developing novel combination approaches, alleviating therapeutic resistance caused due to the presence of CAFs in the GBM microenvironment. The results of this study have the potential to significantly attenuate therapeutic resistance in GBM and provide much needed treatment options and improvement in survival, for what remains one of the most dismal diagnoses in the clinic.\n Citation Format: Ankita Sati, Aakriti Mathur, Meeki Lad, Atul Saha, Manish K.

The costimulatory signal of CD27 is mediated via the NFkB pathway but also via the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the protein kinase B pathways. CD27 signaling also influences the innate immune response via direct activation of NK cells and subsequent secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNg). Several published preclinical studies demonstrated that anti-CD27 agonistic monoclonal antibodies can promote T-cell activation and antitumor immunity making CD27 an attractive cancer immunotherapy target. Here we describe the characterization, preclinical development, and selection of our anti-CD27 fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) lead candidate. We selected this candidate from a library of 147 anti-CD27 mAbs generated after immunization of humanized Trianni® mice with soluble human CD27 extracellular domain (hCD27-ECD). Anti-CD27 mAbs were tested in an accelerated stability study and showed excellent stability parameters for up to 7 days at 4 and 37°C in commonly used formulation buffers. The selected agonist anti-CD27 mAb demonstrated high affinity binding to both human and cynomolgus monkey CD27 and not to mouse CD27. It also demonstrated high specificity against CD27 with no cross-reactivity detected against other members of the TNFRSF. This lead candidate did not block the binding of CD27 natural ligand, CD70 and induced strong NFkB-mediated CD27 signaling in the absence or presence of cross-linking by Fc gamma receptors or secondary cross-linking antibodies. Moreover, this anti-CD27 mAb mediated NFkB activation is significantly potentiated by the addition of a sub-optimal amount of soluble CD70. The anti-CD27 lead mAb induced T cell proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines only in the presence of sub-optimal TCR stimulation in vitro using primary human T cells. It also activated NK cells demonstrated by CD69 expression induction. The anti-CD27 mAb lead candidate showed extended serum half-life in hCD27-KI mice. It also demonstrated a significant antitumor effect as a single agent in human CD27-Knockin mice (hCD27-KI) subcutaneously implanted with MC38 or in NOD-SCID mice subcutaneously implanted with Raji. These preclinical results establish that the selected anti-CD27 mAb is a promising drug candidate and we are actively pursuing its development.\n Citation Format: Thierry Guillaudeux, Yulia Ovechkina, Kurt Lustig, Shawn Iadonato.

    "abstract" : "Background Researchers are currently concentrating on molecular markers and potential therapeutic targets associated with gastric cancer in light of recent developments in precision medicine and molecular biology. Disulfidptosis was first proposed in 2023 as a novel programmed cell death mode associated with the cytoskeleton. Disulfidptosis-related proteins are essential for the preservation of protein stability and abnormal expression of disulfidptosis-related genes may be linked to cancer development and drug resistance. Materials and method The gastric cancer transcriptomic data were retrieved from TCGA database, and disulfidptosis-related genes were identified through literature search. Utilizing machine learning methods such as LASSO, Random Forest (RF), Boruta, SVM-RFE, and XGBoost, the disulfidptosis-related gene NUBPL was determined as a potential predictor for gastric cancer. PPI network was constructed, and the GO database as well as the KEGG database were employed to analyze the protein interactions and pathway enrichment of NUBPL in gastric cancer. Meanwhile, the ESTIMATE algorithm was used for immune infiltration analysis and prediction of immunotherapy response, and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database was utilized for the drug sensitivity analysis of NUBPL. The role of NUBPL in gastric cancer and its inhibition of disulfidptosis were validated using molecular biological methods. Results The aberrant expression of NUBPL significantly impacts the prognosis of gastric cancer and modulates metabolic and immune-related pathways. In patients with elevated NUBPL expression levels, a reduced number of CD8-positive T cells is associated with adverse prognosis and gastric cancer progression. Elevated NUBPL expression levels can impair the function of chemokines. Moreover, patients with lower NUBPL expression levels exhibit better responses to immunotherapy. We have also identified drugs such as QS11, Imatinib, and AS601245 as potential inhibitors of NUBPL. In vitro experiments have shown that NUBPL affects the invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells, rather than proliferation and apoptosis, by regulating the PPP pathway and inhibiting disulfidptosis. Conclusion This study underscores the pivotal role of NUBPL in gastric cancer progression and highlights its significance as a potential target for targeted therapy and immunotherapy gastric cancer, NUBPL, disulfidptosis, biomarker, immunotherapy, machine learning"

    "abstract" : "\n Background:\n We previously demonstrated that a kinase-based taxonomy of TNBC was most parsimonious than next-generation sequencing in defining TNBC subtypes associated with prognostic categories in early disease. The most aggressive TNBC variants were driven by a heterogeneous set of genetic aberrations that converged in the increased activity of 6 kinases: KIT, PNKP, PRKCE, P70S6K, ERK and CDK6 (Nat Commun; 9:3501-18). The combined inhibition of these kinases in pairs led to potent tumor regression in preclinical models, being the most powerful combination that one directed against CDK6 and ERK. This prompted us to design a phase II trial testing the combination of palbociclib (against CDK6) and binimetinib (against the ERK upstream kinase MEK, since no ERK inhibitor was available at that moment outside phase I trials) in advanced TNBC. Hyperactivation of CDK6 and/or ERK was selected as entry criterion.\n Trial design:\n This was a single-arm, prospective, multicentric, open-label, phase II investigator-initiated trial. CDK6 and phosphor-ERK levels were measured in tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and normalized with a reference sample collection to a Z-score. Patients with scores for either kinase above the median were candidates for the trial. Key inclusion criteria included metastatic >18year-old TNBC, adequate organ function, measurable disease, and progression to 1-2 prior treatment lines (including immunotherapy, and a PARP inhibitor in case of germline BRCA1/2 mutation). Patients started continuous oral binimetinib at 45 mg/BID and palbociclib 100 mg/day from days 1 to 21, in 28-day cycles. Patients experiencing ≤ grade 1 tolerable side effects as the greatest toxicity were escalated to palbociclib to 125 in cycle 2. RECIST 1.1 and NCI CTC AE V 5.0 were used for assessing disease control (q8 weeks) and toxicity. The primary aims were to assess the efficacy and toxicity of this combination, and the secondary one to detect biomarkers of activity. At the time of trial design, in absence of available Sacituzumab for prescription, the reference PFS to beat in advanced lines for physician’s choice in TNBC was 1.7 month (NEJM; 384:1529-41, 2021). With alpha and beta errors of 0.05 and 0.2, the minimum number of patients to demonstrate a 30% improvement in PFS to 2.5 months was 25.\n Results:\n From November 2020 to April 2023, 69 patients were screened and 24 entered the trial (5 positive for phosphor-ERK; 2 for CDK6; 17 for both). Toxicity was generally mild and included grade 1-2 diarrhea (33% of the patients), grade 1-2 asthenia (50%), grade 1-3 neutropenia (75%), grade 2 retinal toxicity (8.3%) and grade 3 rash (4.2%); no grade 4/5 toxicities were observed. Median PFS was 1.83 months (range 0.3 to 11.3+). Phospho-ERK and CDK6 levels were not correlated (Pearson’s R= -0.089; P=0.68); CDK6 levels did not show association with PFS time (R = -0.120; P=0.58). Interestingly, however, phosphor-ERK levels in the baseline tumor sample showed correlation with PFS time (R = 0.428; P=0.037).\n Conclusion:\n The combination of palbociclib and binimetinib was generally safe, and PFS time showed correlation with baseline phosphorylation levels of ERK.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with pembrolizumab (NAC+P) has become the standard care for stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) following the KEYNOTE-522 (KN522) trial, which showed improved pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone (NAC). We aimed to describe pCR rates by age and treatment in TNBC patients receiving either NAC+P or NAC alone at our institution. Methods: Women aged ≥65 years with stage I-III TNBC treated with NAC+P from 6/2021 to 9/2023 were compared to patients aged <65 years treated with NAC+P and to patients ≥65 who received NAC alone from 03/2010 to 9/2019. Patients with metaplastic breast cancer and neoadjuvant radiotherapy were excluded. Clinicopathological characteristics and pCR rates (ypT0/is pN0) - were compared between groups using Chi-square tests. Logistic regression for univariate (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA) was used to evaluate the association between age, treatment, and pCR. Results: 481 patients were included: 69 NAC+P ≥65 years (median age 69, IQR: 67-73); 338 NAC+P <65 years (median age 48, IQR: 38-56); and 74 NAC ≥65 years (median age 69, IQR: 66-73). Compared to younger patients, older patients treated with NAC+P were more likely to have public insurance (87% vs 13%, p<.001), lobular and other non-ductal histologies (6% vs 1.2% and 10% vs 5%, respectively, p= .009), cT1 and cT4 stages (22% vs 11% and 13% vs 3.9%, respectively, p< .001) and cN+ disease at presentation (58% vs 45%, p=.04). In both age groups, 81% received the KN522 backbone regimen with carboplatin, and the remaining mostly received NAC with cyclophosphamide, anthracycline, and taxane. There was no difference in treatment completion rate - defined as the completion of all preplanned neoadjuvant therapy cycles regardless of interruptions, regimen changes, or dose reductions - and in immune-related adverse events (33%) between age groups. However, older patients had a longer time from NAC+P to surgery (38 vs 32 days, p= .002). Breast surgery was similar between age groups, but axillary dissection (ALND) was more common in older patients (32% vs 19%, p= .023). The pCR rates did not differ between older and younger patients (49% vs 58%, p=.2). On MVA, high tumor grade (OR 13.9, 95% CI 4.54-61.7, p< .001) was positively associated with pCR, whereas other histologies (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.39, p< .001), cT4 stage (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p<.001) and cN+(OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.95, p= .029) were less likely to facilitate pCR.In patients ≥65 years, those receiving NAC+P, compared to NAC alone, more frequently had lobular and other histologies (6% vs 0% and 10% vs 4.1%, respectively, p= .028), intermediate tumor grade (15% vs 1.4%, p=0.003), and cT1 and cT2 stages (22% vs 16% and 61% vs 46%, respectively, p= .045).NAC+P patients more frequently received carboplatin (81% vs 6.8%, p<.001). There was no difference in NAC completion and time to treatment start, but the NAC+P group had longer time to surgery (38 vs. 30 days, p = 0.039). More NAC patients underwent ALND (56% vs 32%, p= .005), with no difference in cN+ disease and breast surgery. The pCR rates were significantly higher in the NAC+P group (49%) compared to NAC (23%, p=.001). On UVA, NAC+P significantly improved overall pCR (OR 3.26 p=.001). However, on MVA, after adjusting for tumor histology, grade, stage, neoadjuvant carboplatin, and completion rate, the use of immunotherapy was not independently associated with pCR. Conclusions: Within the NAC+P cohort, pCR rates did not differ by age, and no significant increase in irAEs was seen in elderly patients, though we acknowledge a possible selection bias toward healthier elderly patients. Compared to NAC only, NAC+P showed potential for improving pCR in older individuals and could be a viable treatment option for elderly TNBC patients who are likely to tolerate it.\n Citation Format: Natalia Polidorio, Lauren M.

    "abstract" : "e24135 Background: In different clinical studies worldwide, the use of immunotherapy has been related to the development of hypothyroidism; However, there is no data on this association in Latin American population. Methods: An analytical observational case-control study conducted in a 3-year follow-up cohort at an oncology institute of cancer patients treated with immunotherapy who developed hypothyroidism in Colombia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the development of new hypothyroidism cases after immunotherapy. Cases and controls were randomized in a ratio of 1:3. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for developing hypothyroidism and an inferential analysis was performed over time between levothyroxine dose vs TSH levels. Results: 112 patients were included, 57% men and 42% women with a mean age of 63 years. 21% developed hypothyroidism after immunotherapy, while 12% presented with thyrotoxicosis as first alteration and 9% with central hypothyroidism. During the first semester 54% of patients developed hypothyroidism, 84% in the first year and 100% at 2 years . Pembrolizumab and nivolumab were used most frequently with 58% and 29% respectively developing hypothyroidism. The most common underlying pathology was lung cancer with 33% and kidney at 38%. In the multivariate analysis, female were found as a protective factor compared to men (OR:0.10 CI: 0.05-0.63 95% p = 0.02), and the use of pembrolizumab was associated with a higher risk trend, but this result was not statistically significant (OR:2.49 CI: 0.5-2.7 p = 0.2). The average initial dose of levothyroxine was 1.4 mcg/kg, at 3 months of 1.2 mcg/kg and 6 months of 0.82 mcg/kg. Average TSH levels at diagnosis were 23.3, uUI/ml, achieving target values for 100% of patients after 9 months of substitution. After two years of follow-up, patients continued with an average dose of levothyroxine of 0.8 mcg/kg. Conclusions: The incidence of hypothyroidism in our population is similar to that reported worldwide. Male patients who start immunotherapy should have their thyroid profile monitored strictly given that they present a higher risk. Additionally, monthly monitoring of the thyroid profile should be done within the first year. In Latin American population, more conservative initial doses of levothyroxine (1.0 - 1.1 mcg/kg) could be used and titrated."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a 12.5% 5-year survival rate and is predicted to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. PDAC is known to be resistant to immunotherapy. Thus, while chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy shows the potential to mediate durable responses against some hematologic and solid tumors, in PDAC, the efficacy of CAR T therapy has remained limited. PDAC tumors show heterogenous T cell infiltration with some tumors containing a high number of T cells. As T cell infiltration associates with prolonged survival, we hypothesized that the density of pre-existing T cell infiltration would predict response to CAR T therapy. Methods: Previously established clonal mouse PDAC cell lines, which show a T cell inflamed or non-inflamed tumor microenvironment upon in vivo implantation, were used. Mouse CAR T cells specific to mesothelin, a tumor antigen expressed by PDAC, were generated using retroviral transduction. Mice were implanted subcutaneously with T cell inflamed or non-inflamed tumor cell lines. Ten days later mesothelin CAR T cells were administered intravenously. Flow cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to define the density and spatial location of CAR T cell infiltration. The impact of CAR T cells on tumor growth and survival was also measured. Results: CAR T cells were found to traffic to T cell inflamed tumors, which led to delayed tumor outgrowth. However, such results were not seen in T cell non-inflamed tumors. Rather in mice with T cell non-inflamed tumors, CAR T cells accumulated in the liver. Further, CAR T cells effectively eliminated T cell inflamed and non-inflamed tumor cells in vitro, demonstrating that tumor intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to T cell killing were not a major determinant of treatment efficacy. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of CAR T cells in PDAC but highlight mechanisms of T cell exclusion as a therapeutic barrier wherein CAR T cells accumulate in host organs.\n Citation Format: Jacqueline B.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: RP3, a tumor-directed oncolytic immunotherapy (TDOI), is a selectively replication-competent HSV-1 that contains the codon-optimized sequence for the fusogenic GALV-GP-R- protein, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, CD40L, and 4-1BBL. The expression of GALV-GP-R- potentiates immunogenic tumor cell death through the induction of cell-to-cell fusion. CD40L enhances dendritic cell and macrophage activation and 4-1BBL promotes CD8+ T-cell activation and co-stimulation. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2, further enhancing T cell activation. RP3 is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with or without nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04735978).\n Methods: CD1 nude mice with A375 melanoma xenograft tumors (Group 1) were treated with a single intratumoral injection of 1 × 107 PFU/mL of RP3. Tumors and blood samples were collected 3 days later, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect CD40L, 4-1BBL and HSV-1. For anti-CTLA-4 detection, two doses of 107 PFU/mL of RP3 were injected intratumorally into C57BL/6 mice bearing 4434 murine BRAFV600E mutant melanoma tumors (Group 2). Tumors and blood samples were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15-days post-dosing and anti-CTLA-4 ELISA was performed. For clinical biomarker studies, tumor biopsies were collected pre- and post-RP3 treatment. CD8 and PD-L1 were characterized by IHC, and gene expression analysis (GEA) was performed. TCR analysis was also performed using PBMCs.\n Results: IHC analysis from Group 1 confirmed abundant and widespread expression of CD40-L and 4-1BBL, which were detected alongside with HSV-1 antigen. In the blood samples collected from Group 2, robust levels of anti-CTLA-4 antibody were detected, which stayed in detectable range up to 15 days after the 2nd RP3 injection. IHC analysis of patient tumor samples demonstrated a marked increase in CD8 T cells and PD-L1 expression. GEA of patient tumor biopsies demonstrated increased levels of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune activation and genes previously reported to be associated with responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. TCR sequencing of PBMCs and multiplex IHC analysis are ongoing and updated results will be presented.\n Conclusion: Preclinical experiments from mice models confirmed the robust expression of CD40-L, 4-1BBL and anti-CTLA-4 in RP3-injected tumors. Biomarker studies from patients demonstrate increases in CD8-T cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression post RP3 +/- nivolumab treatment, including increases in the expression of genes associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. These data indicate the potential for broad utility of RP3 in a range of tumor types, including in tumors that are not sensitive to PD-1 blockade.\n Citation Format: Praveen K.

    "abstract" : "\n Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancers (ECs) are defined by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, including MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1. Lynch syndrome (LS) tumors have received increased attention in the therapeutic context as these tumors are microsatellite instable and often reflect increased immune cell infiltration and enhanced response to immunotherapy. However, relatively little attention has been paid to pathogenesis of LS ECs. Women with LS represent an at-risk population who could benefit from cancer interception strategies due to a 60% cumulative lifetime risk of developing EC. We developed a mouse model of MSH2 loss targeted to the uterus to evaluate EC pathogenesis, with the goal of elucidating mechanisms that alter disease penetrance for women with hereditary risk for EC development. Our Progesterone Receptor-Cre Msh2f lox/flox mice (abbreviated Msh2KO) develop ECs that closely mimic human EC. Whole transcriptome profiling of Msh2KO EC and Msh2KO normal endometrium compared to wild-type endometrium identified “Mitochondrial dysfunction” as a significantly altered pathway in Msh2 deficiency, prompting our in-depth evaluation of mitochondrial alterations in Msh2KO mice, MSH2-deficient cell lines, and LS-associated EC patient specimens. We will discuss the impact of MSH2 deficiency across multiple measures of mitochondrial content, integrity, function, and metabolomic analyses in ECs using preclinical models and human tissue studies. Overall, our studies reveal that MSH2-deficient EC is characterized by mitochondrial DNA damage, mitochondrial content reduction, and decreased mitochondrial function. In addition, decreased mitochondrial respiration for energy production facilitates metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis. We are conducting further studies to define mechanisms underlying mitochondrial defects due to MSH2 loss and opportunities for intervention. Mitochondrial and metabolic aberrations could serve as novel biomarkers for EC development and targets for cancer prevention in women with LS.\n Citation Format: Melinda S. Yates.

We retrieved data from NPC-EA transcriptomic repositories: 6 GE datasets, including tumor and normal samples (GSE12452, GSE34573, GSE132112, GSE53819, GSE68799, GSE102349); one validation dataset with both EA and NEA(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5347891); 4 GE signatures associated with prognosis and treatment prediction (PMID: 24297049, 35262435, 32596151, 33096113); and NPC EBV related genes/pathways and gene sets (PMID: 35846746, 35394843, 35105963; Liu NPC, Wood EBV EBNA1 Down, Sengupta NPC LMP1 UP, REACTOME DNA Repair; Hallmarks). The 6 datasets were integrated using a bioinformatic meta-analysis approach, and the classifier method was applied to the validation dataset in order to identify the subtype with worst prognosis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed on 50 Italian NEA NPC samples (INT188/19; GSE208281). Biological and functional profiling of EA and NEA were performed using xCell, Gene set enrichment analyses, and treatment prediction methods (PMID: 16103067, pRRophetic R, PMID: 28052254). Four clusters (Cl) were identified through a meta-analysis of EA-NPC. Prognostic analyses revealed that Cl3 had the worst prognosis (P=0.0476), confirmed by three of the four prognostic signatures and in the validation dataset (P=0.0368). Based on the biological and functional characterization of these clusters, we arrived at the following GE subtypes: Cl1, Immune-active; Cl2, Defense-response; Cl3, Proliferation; Cl4, Perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion. According to the treatment prediction methods, the sensitivity of each cluster was radiotherapy and immunotherapy for immune-active, radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy for defense-response, chemotherapy for proliferation, and cisplatin treatment for perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion. In our NEA cohort, only three clusters were expressed (excluding perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion). Immune/biological characterization and treatment prediction analyses of NEA partially replicated the EA results. Our study provides a relevant biological overview of EBV-related NPC in both EA and NEA. The immune microenvironment plays a critical role in NPC owing to the viral etiology of this malignancy. The presence of a perineural-interaction/EBV-exhaustion cluster in EA suggests an inactive EBV infection according to the viral related “hit and run theory”; however, further analyses are needed. The immune/biological characterization of EA and NEA may help predict the response to different therapeutic strategies.\n Citation Format: Deborah Lenoci, Carlo Resteghini, Mara Serena Serafini, Federico Pistore, Silvana Canevari, Brigette B.Y.

Methods: We enrolled 320 patients treated for mNSCLC between January 2012 and December 2023. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for all parameters for prognostic evaluation. Results: Among 320 patients; median age was 63 years. Either presence of bone metastasis (p=0.005), brain metastasis (p=0.024), liver metastasis (p=0.08) and the number of metastasis is 3 or more (p=0.02) were associated with better PFS in univariate analysis. ECOG performance status 0-1 (p=0.001), de novo metastatic disease (p=0.05), bone metastasis (p=0.001), brain metastasis (p=0.016), liver metastasis (p=0.00), also the number of metastasis 3 or more (p=0.001) and use of immunotherapy (p=0.00) were related with longer OS. In multivariate analysis, either presence of brain metastasis (HR:1.50, 95% CI:1.13-1.99, p=0.004), liver metastasis (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06-2.21, p=0.02), number of metastatic site (HR:0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, p=0.03) and use of immunotherapy (HR:0.37, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.52, p=0.00) remained significant predictors of OS. Conclusion: Our results showed that liver and brain metastasis, number of metastatic site and use of immunotherapy were assosiated with survival and these can be used as stratification factors when designing randomized clinical trials."

    "abstract" : "Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that promotes tissue homeostasis by identifying damaged cells for immune-mediated clearance. Thus, the ability to evade senescence and the ensuing immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Reactivation of senescence programs can result in profound immune-mediated tumor regressions or sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, although the aberrant persistence of senescent cells can promote tissue decline and contribute to the side effects of some cancer therapies. In this review, we first briefly describe the discovery of senescence as a tumor-suppressive program. Next, we highlight the dueling good and bad effects of the senescence-associated secretory program (SASP) in cancer, including SASP-dependent immune effects. We then summarize the beneficial and deleterious effects of senescence induction by cancer therapies and strategies in development to leverage senescence therapeutically. Finally, we highlight challenges and unmet needs in understanding senescence in cancer and developing senescence-modulating therapies.

    "abstract" : "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE\nPancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality. At the time of diagnosis, majority of patients (80-90%) present with either locally advanced unresectable disease or metastatic disease. Even after curative resection, the recurrence rate remains quite high. This article aimed at reviewing the updated management of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe identified literature by searching Medline and PubMed from January 2010 to June 2023 using the keywords.\n\n\nKEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS\nA multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize the outcomes for both curable and advanced diseases. Management of pancreatic cancer divided into resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic diseases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment approach for resectable pancreatic cancer. The recommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with good functional status is modified FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). The recommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with suboptimal functional status is gemcitabine plus capecitabine or monotherapy gemcitabine. The optimal treatment strategy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is still uncertain. Traditionally, upfront surgery is the choice of treatment. There is increasing evidence showing benefits of neoadjuvant therapy in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. However, the optimal neoadjuvant treatment regimen was not certain yet. Advancement of chemotherapy has a positive impact for the survival of advanced disease. For patients with good functional status, the recommended first-line systemic chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced disease or metastatic disease is combination chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel. For patients with suboptimal functional status, the recommended first-line systemic chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced disease or metastatic disease is gemcitabine plus capecitabine or monotherapy gemcitabine. Recently, more researches showed promising results in the use of nanoliposomal irinotecan, targeted agents such as a poly [adenosine diphosphate (ADB)-ribose] polymerase inhibitor, tyrosine receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors, and immune checkpoint-inhibitors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPancreatic cancer is a challenging disease for management. Radical surgery itself is not enough for prolong survival. The improvement of chemotherapy, target agents and immunotherapy with multidisciplinary approach will be the only solution for improvement of survival outcome and quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer."

    "abstract" : "\n Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood is an emerging biomarker candidate of immunotherapy in a wide range of cancers. However, little is known about the potential relationships between the tumor immune microenvironment and systemic inflammatory markers including NLR. Here we have explored systemic and tumor-immune microenvironmental characteristics related to treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibition, based on 29 consecutive patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who received pembrolizumab between 2020 and 2021. NLR greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status significantly correlated with short overall survival (OS). Although NLR did not show a significant association with tumor volumes, high NLR exhibited significant correlations with malnutrition status characterized by CONUT (controlling nutritional status), and GNRI (geriatric nutrition risk index). Among the patients whose NLR was greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status, those whose NLR decreased to less than 4.5 at day 21 had a better OS than those whose NLR did not decrease, indicating that longitudinal changes in NLR correlate with prognosis. To investigate association with tumor-immune microenvironment, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to quantitatively evaluate intratumoral CD8+ T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and granulocytes. Notably, NLR at pretreatment status significantly correlated with intratumoral immune cell densities, where high NLR correlated with low lymphoid cells and high tumor associated macrophages in tissue. NLR in peripheral blood significantly correlated with myeloid to lymphoid cell ratios in tissue, suggesting the presence of association between circulating and intratumoral immune complexity profiles. This study highlights that the association between intratumoral myeloid predominance and systemic nutritional and inflammatory status might be a possible factor for resistance to immunotherapy. Understanding immune dynamics in tissue and blood during immunotherapy potentially contributes to the establishment of predictive biomarkers and monitoring for immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Hiroki Morimoto, Takahiro Tsujikawa, Aya Miyagawa-Hayashino, Alisa Kimura, Sumiyo Saburi, Junichi Mitsuda, Kanako Yoshimura, Gaku Ohmura, Shigeyuki Mukudai, Hikaru Nagao, Yoichiro Sugiyama, Shibata Saya, Hiroshi Ogi, Eiichi Konishi, Kyoko Itoh, Shigeru Hirano.

    "abstract" : "\n Glioblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy and has a median overall survival of only 8 months after diagnosis [1]. In recent years, chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown unprecedented efficacy against advanced B-cell malignancies. However, the application of CAR-T cell therapy to solid tumors, including GBM, has been largely unsuccessful [2]. In glioblastoma, two key challenges curtail CAR-T cell efficacy: tumor heterogeneity, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [2]. To address solid-tumor challenges, one approach is to equip CAR-T cells with one or more immunomodulatory proteins, a term commonly referred to as “armoring” the CAR-T cells. In this work, we have engineered CAR-T cells to secrete combinations of armor proteins, such that the CAR-T cells can not only directly attack tumor cells, but also remodel the tumor milieu to inhibit immunosuppression and engage endogenous immunity as a powerful complementary force. Through an in vivo screen of potentially synergistic armor combinations, we have found that CAR-T cells engineered to secrete both IL-12 and the decoy-resistant form of IL-18 (CAR-12.DR18 T cells) are remarkably efficacious against syngeneic, orthotopic, antigen-heterogenous glioblastoma tumors. However, this combination of potent cytokines also results in transient but significant toxicity. Upon interrogating various toxicity reduction strategies, we found that pooling CAR-12.DR18 T cells with CAR-T cells that secrete a novel anti-VEGF scFv ameliorates toxicity while maintaining robust efficacy.

    "abstract" : "\n Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite the advent of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) that has markedly changed the treatment landscape for select tumors with respect to both outcomes and tolerability, PDAC remains unresponsive to such an approach. One feature of the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) that remains poorly understood is the interaction between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune and tumor cells. Unique subsets of CAFs have been identified, including antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which are defined by expression of MHC-II and can activate CD4 T cells in genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. apCAFs are rarely found in human PDAC; in a human PDAC atlas consisting of six published human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we identified 370 apCAFs out of 8736 total CAFs, the majority of which were found in one dataset. Here, we have orthotopically implanted cell lines derived from the autochthonous KPC murine model of PDAC which mimics the stromal components of human disease to further study the influence of apCAFs on the anti-tumor response. We have found that although the overall CAF population is equivalent between tumors, apCAFs are present primarily in tumors derived from KPC cell lines that display ICI sensitivity. apCAFs sorted from these tumors and pulsed with OVA peptides upregulated CD25 and CD69 expression on naïve OT-II CD4 T cells, confirming that apCAFs in our system can present via MHC-II. Furthermore, these apCAFs increased CD4 activation markers upon ex-vivo coculture with dissociated KPC tumors. We therefore hypothesize that apCAFs are required for the ICI-mediated anti-tumor effect and do so via modulation of CD4 T cell responses. Although a small proportion of the total compartment, the apCAF subset may be enhanced in number and function by CAF-targeted modulators to synergize with ICI to affect the antitumor response, which could provide a solution to the currently unmet need for new and more effective treatments for PDAC patients.\n Citation Format: Saumya Maru, Kathryn Howe, Lalitya Andaloori, James Leatherman, Joseph Tandurella, Edward J.

These observations suggest that TILs may be general markers of patient outcomes, but evidence in support of this hypothesis has been limited by small cohorts.\n We validated ImmunoPROFILE, a multiplexed immunofluorescence (MIF)-based assay coupled with machine-learning-based image analysis, to identify and quantify tumor cells (cytokeratin, PAX5, PAX8, SOX10), T cells (CD8), T-regulatory cells (FOXP3), exhausted cells (PD-1) and immunosuppressive tumor and immune cells (PD-L1). We applied the MIF panel to specimens from patients collected prospectively over three years and analyzed 2,023 cases across 27 tumor types. The association between biomarkers and overall survival (OS) was investigated using Cox models controlling for patient risk factors such as cancer type, metastatic vs. primary disease, age, and gender. Multivariable biomarker selection was based on likelihood ratios.\n The assay was highly robust (success rate 97%), reproducible (inter-scanning and intra-staining density controls within 1 SD, inter-staining PD-L1 scores ≤11% CV), and operator-independent (R2 >0.7 to >0.9 for each biomarker and 95% concordance in PD-L1 score-based interpretation between technicians). From whole slide images, a total of 11,932 individual regions of interest were analyzed across the cohort, resulting in >50 million spatially-resolved single cells which were summarized into cell population densities and PD-L1 scores.\n High densities of CD8+ (>64/mm2, p<0.0001), PD-1+ (>50/mm2, p<0.0001), and FOXP3+ (>30/mm2, p<0.0001) T cells were associated with longer overall survival (OS) irrespective of therapy and across all cancer types. PD-L1 metrics were not associated with OS (p=0.43). Compared to patients with low densities of CD8+ and PD-1+ cells, high densities of at least one of these cell types had better OS (Both high, HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.59; CD8+ high, HR: 0.63, (0.48 - 0.82); PD-1+ high, HR: 0.71, (0.54 - 0.93)). The results were consistent in the subset of patients (N=1572) who did not receive immunotherapy (IO). In patients who received IO therapy (N=451), only PD-1+ T-cell density associated with OS (HR: 0.48, (0.36 - 0.65)).\n To our knowledge, this is the first enterprise-level immune biomarker assay using multiplexed staining, digital imaging, and machine learning to be applied in a prospective manner to clinical specimens at scale. We found that select immune cell densities are prognostic across cancer types and therapies and demonstrated that quantification of multiple cell populations yields better prognostic power than single marker analyses.\n Citation Format: James Lindsay, Bijaya Sharma, Kristen D.

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Antiangiogenic drugs have demonstrated synergistic effect with anti-PD-1 antibody in advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Anlotinib is an oral multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that strongly inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit. Preclinical studies showed that metronomic chemotherapy inhibited angiogenesis and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy in TNBC via modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. We hereby conducted a single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus anlotinib and metronomic chemotherapy as a potential novel therapeutic strategy in advanced TNBC and explore potential biomarkers. Methods: Forty-four cases were planning to be included in this trial. The eligible patients who had received no more than two lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were enrolled and received sintilimab (200 mg iv q3w) and anlotinib (12 mg po d1-14 q3w) plus capecitabine (500 mg po, tid) or vinorelbine (40 mg po, tiw) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The safety profile has also been assessed. Results: As of April 2023, a total of 44 patients were enrolled, and 42 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 3 patients (7.1%) achieved complete response (CR). 6 patients (14.3%) achieved partial response (PR). 25 patients (59.5%) achieved stable disease (SD).The ORR is 21.4% (95%CI 0.103-0.368) and DCR is 81.0% (95%CI 0.810-0.659). The median PFS was 5.06 months (95%CI 2.051-8.069). The most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events (AEs) include elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (52.38%, 22/42), elevated bilirubin (23.81%, 10/42), hand-foot syndrome (22.22%, 8/42), leukopenia (16.67%,7/42), nausea (14.29%, 6/42).

    "abstract" : "Background and Objective Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype, historically managed with chemotherapy regimens predominantly involving anthracyclines and taxanes, yielding unfavorable prognoses. This review endeavors to offer a thorough examination of the present state of treatment strategies for early stage triple negative breast cancer (eTNBC), with a particular emphasis on immunotherapy modalities, combination therapies, predictive biomarkers, and ongoing clinical trials. The principal aim of this review is to meticulously assess the available literature, ascertain significant discoveries, and engage in discussions regarding their potential implications for future research endeavors, clinical applications, and policy formulation. Methods This review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, with the latest update performed in March 2023. The search strategy was designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the literature, with a focus on recent advancements. Key Content and Findings We critically assess the current eTNBC treatment landscape, covering efficacy and limitations of monotherapy, combination therapies, and predictive biomarkers. We highlight promising results from recent trials, address controversies surrounding chemotherapy, and explore optimal approaches for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Insights into personalized treatment strategies, ongoing trials, and future perspectives are provided, advancing our understanding of therapeutic options for eTNBC. Conclusions Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, this review highlights the potential of immunotherapy, particularly in combination with chemotherapy, as a promising approach for treating eTNBC. However, further research is warranted to optimize treatment strategies, refine patient selection criteria, and identify reliable biomarkers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The findings of this review hold significant implications for future research, clinical practice, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the current challenges and advancements in eTNBC treatment. Ultimately, this knowledge can contribute to improved patient outcomes, enhanced quality of life, and the development of more effective therapeutic approaches for eTNBC."

Durvalumab plus tremelimumab and chemotherapy (T+D+CT) is a novel therapeutic strategy for mNSCLC, which demonstrated promising efficacy in a phase-3 randomized clinical trial, but its economic value remains unclear. Methods This economic evaluation used a hypothetical cohort of patients with mNSCLC, with characteristics mirroring those of the participants in the POSEIDON trial. Several partitioned survival models were constructed to estimate 15-year costs and health outcomes associated with the T+D+CT, durvalumab plus chemotherapy (D+CT) and chemotherapy alone (CT) strategies, discounting costs and effectiveness at 3% annually. Costs were in 2023 US dollars. Data were derived from the POSEIDON trial and published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of input parameters and study generalizability. The analysis was designed and conducted from September 2022 to March 2023. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of T+D+CT, compared with CT and D+CT, for mNSCLC from the perspectives of the US healthcare sector and society. Findings From the healthcare sector’s perspective, the T+D+CT yielded an additional 0.09 QALYs at an increased cost of $7,108 compared with CT, which resulted in an ICER of $82,501/QALY. The T+D+CT strategy yielded an additional 0.02 QALYs at an increased cost of $27,779 compared with the D+CT, which resulted in an ICER of $1,243,868/QALY. The economic results of T+D+CT vs. CT were most sensitive to the annual discount rate, subsequent immunotherapy cost, tremelimumab cost, palliative care and death cost, pemetrexed cost, and durvalumab cost. The T+D+CT strategy was considered cost-effective relative to CT in 59%–82% of model iterations against willingness-to-pay. thresholds of $100,000/QALY gained to $150,000/QALY gained. From the societal perspective, the T+D+CT can be considered as cost-effective as compared with CT or D+CT, independent of histology. Implications In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the T+D+CT strategy represented good value compared with CT for patients with mNSCLC from the perspectives of the healthcare sector and the society. This treatment strategy may be prioritized for mNSCLC patients at high risks of disease progression."

Immunosuppression is an established risk factor for developing MCC, but IC patients have typically been excluded from clinical trials of immunotherapies. We report an analysis of clinical characteristics, survival outcomes, and safety in IC and non-IC patients with MCC treated with avelumab in routine clinical practice in Germany.\n Methods:\n This prospective, noninterventional, multicenter, dynamic cohort study (MCC-TRIM; EUPAS25338) enrolled patients with MCC in Germany between April 2019 and September 2023. Primary data from a study-specific electronic case report form and secondary data from the German national skin cancer registry were combined. For this analysis, avelumab-treated patients were grouped as IC or non-IC based on prespecified comorbid conditions and concomitant medications. Survival outcomes with first-line avelumab treatment were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n Results:\n Among 875 patients with MCC (various disease stages) enrolled in the study, 243 were treated with avelumab, of whom 189 (77.8%) were considered non-IC and 54 (22.2%) were considered IC. Patient characteristics are summarized in the Table. At data cutoff (March 2024), median follow-up (IQR) was 14.3 months (6.4-29.4) in the non-IC subgroup and 8.9 (4.2-22.8) in the IC subgroup. In non-IC and IC subgroups, median (95% CI) overall survival from start of first-line avelumab was 38.2 (15.7-not estimable) and 9.9 (4.8-29.8) months, and median progression-free survival was 7.9 (4.0-11.6) and 4.3 (1.0-7.8) months, respectively.

    "abstract" : "\n CD8+ T cells are indispensable for pathogen and tumor clearance, although can induce immunopathology if left unrestricted. T cell exhaustion, progressively programmed in the context of persistent antigen exposure, ensures partial control while mitigating immunopathological risk. However, exhaustion is characterized by curtailed proliferative capacity, cytokine production and cytotoxic functions, which tumors and chronic pathogens exploit to persist. As such, transiently disrupting exhaustion has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. Exhausted cells transition through a range of differentiation states, from stem-like progenitors that mediate response to checkpoint blockade, through to terminal effector or exhausted cells. Understanding the molecular pathways moderating the exhausted states and promoting terminal exhaustion is essential for augmenting cancer immunotherapy. We identify IKZF transcription factors, Ikaros (IKZF1), Helios (IKZF2) and Aiolos (IKZF3), as key mediators of T cell exhaustion, using gene knock-out mice and a CRISPR-mediated genetic knock-out system in both chronic infection and tumor models. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are critical regulators of exhausted subset expansion, retention, phenotype and cytokine function. Strikingly, dual IKZF1 and IKZF3 ablation boosts the response of anti-tumor and anti-viral exhausted T cells, potentially via the formation of atypical exhausted T cell populations and the enrichment of functional exhausted subsets. Cumulatively, our data highlight a novel role for IKZF transcription factors in biasing exhausted T cell differentiation and provides potentially important clinical implications, directing future cancer immunotherapies targeting T cell exhaustion.\n Citation Format: Sinead M Reading, Isabelle Munoz, Maria Nogueira de Menezes, Nicole Y.L Saw, Krutika Ambani, Antonio Ahn, Simone Nussing, Sara Roth, Shienny Sampurno, Kelly M Ramsbottom, Joseph A Trapani, Kim L Good-Jacobson, Ricky W Johnstone, Shom Goel, Paul A Beavis, Ian A Parish.

Numerous clinical studies have sought to optimize this treatment paradigm to enhance clinical outcomes. In this retrospective real-world study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the addition of induction chemoimmunotherapy prior to the PACIFIC regimen compared with the standard PACIFIC regimen. The aim was to determine whether introducing immunotherapy earlier into the treatment strategy for unresectable stage III NSCLC could improve disease control rates.\n Methods:\n This study included patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Patients received either induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by cCRT or sequential chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) with consolidation immunotherapy, or cCRT/sCRT directly followed by consolidation immunotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the initiation of consolidation immunotherapy to disease progression or death. The incidence of radiation-induced immune pneumonitis was also assessed between the two groups.\n Results:\n A total of 210 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were included in this study, enrolled between July 2019 and April 2023. Among them, 76 patients received induction chemoimmunotherapy, and 134 patients were treated without induction chemoimmunotherapy. Baseline characteristics between the two groups showed no significant differences. The proportion of patients receiving cCRT in the induction chemoimmunotherapy group and the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group was 29/76 (38.1%) and 110/134 (82.1%), respectively. Within each group, there was no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients treated with cCRT or sCRT. The induction chemoimmunotherapy group demonstrated superior median PFS (mPFS) compared to the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group (not reached vs. 17.2 months, P=0.01). Overall survival (OS) data remain immature for analysis. The incidence of pneumonitis was observed in 52/76 (68.4%) patients in the induction chemoimmunotherapy group, with ≥Grade 2 pneumonitis occurring in 18/76 (23.7%) patients. In the non-induction chemoimmunotherapy group, pneumonitis occurred in 86/134 (64.2%) patients, with ≥Grade 2 pneumonitis in 30/134 (22.4%) patients. No significant differences in pneumonitis incidence or severity were observed between the two groups.\n Conclusions:\n The addition of induction chemoimmunotherapy prior to the PACIFIC regimen demonstrated improved disease control rates compared to the standard approach, with no increased risk of pneumonitis.\n"

    "abstract" : "\n Cystatin C (CyC) is a secreted cysteine protease inhibitor that is commonly used as a marker of renal function, and whose biological functions remain insufficiently characterized. Plasma CyC is elevated relative to renal function in many patients, including those receiving glucocorticoid (GC) treatment and patients with cancer. Endogenous GCs are essential for life and are appropriately upregulated in response to systemic stress. Here we empirically connect GCs with the systemic regulation of CyC. Using measurements of CyC and creatinine, another established marker of renal function, we used genome-wide association and structural equation modeling to determine the genetics of the latent trait CyC production in UK Biobank, thereby uncoupling CyC from renal function. CyC production and a polygenic score (PGS) capturing germline predisposition to CyC production predicted elevated all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Using phenome-wide association, we further identified an association between germline predisposition to CyC production and accelerated onset of metabolic syndrome. As a potential explanation for these associations, we provide multiple lines of evidence that CyC is a direct transcriptional target of GC receptor, with GC-responsive CyC secretion exhibited by macrophages (cf. monocytes) and co-opted by multiple cancer cell lines, potentially explaining selective CyC elevations in disease states. Using isogenic CyC-knockout tumors (CRISPR-Cas9), we discovered a markedly attenuated tumor growth in vivo that was associated with a significantly reduced fraction of non-epithelial cells. To investigate whether depletion of specific non-epithelial cells could explain this, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing, which revealed abrogated recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages in knockout tumors, subsequently validated by Trem2 immunohistochemistry in a non-overlapping cohort. Trem2+ macrophages have previously been linked to immune suppression and failure of cancer immunotherapy. Consistent with this, we show that the CyC production PGS predicted checkpoint immunotherapy failure in a combined clinical trial cohort of 685 metastatic cancer patients. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CyC may be a direct effector of GC-induced immunosuppression, acting through the recruitment of Trem2+ macrophages, and therefore could be a target for combination cancer immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Sam O.

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) can potentially cure hematologic malignancies through graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). Several studies have suggested that IFN-γ pathway is critical for GVL sensitivity or resistance in leukemia cells. In mouse model, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generated in IFN-γ receptor-deficient mice acquired resistance to GVL (Matte-Martone, Shlomchik WD, J Clin Invest. 2017). Other groups have reported that IFN-γ restores HLA expression on myeloid blasts from patients who relapsed AMLs after alloSCT. These data support the clinical application of IFN-γ to augment GVL in subjects with post-transplant relapse. However, AML is molecularly heterogeneous, and the IFN-γ responsiveness may vary by AML subtypes. We analyzed IFN-γ responsiveness of primary AML cells and investigated the role of IFN-γ on cell death and T-cell recognition of AML cell lines.\n Methods: Primary AML cells collected at diagnosis (n=60), at relapse after chemotherapy (n=4), and at post-transplant relapse (n=8) were stimulated with IFN-γ at 1 ng/ml or 50 ng/mL in vitro, and IFN-γ responsiveness was analyzed by measuring phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT) after 15 minutes and upregulation of HLA-DR after 48 hours by flow cytometry. U937 and THP-1 cell lines were used to investigate IFN-γ induced cell death and the impact of IFN-γ priming of leukemia cells on the activation of alloreactive T cells. For this, Jurkat cells transduced with anti-HA1 T cell receptor (αHA1-TCR-T) were used, and the activation was analyzed through CD69 upregulation by flow cytometry.\n Results: IFN-γ responsiveness was heterogeneous in both pSTAT1 and HLA-DR upregulation of primary AML blasts. IFN-γ responsiveness also varied within the subpopulation of leukemic blasts within the sample at diagnosis and relapse, implying clonal evolution. Compared to THP-1, U937 cells fail to upregulate HLA-DR with IFN-γ despite appropriate pSTAT1 response to IFN-γ, suggesting silencing of downstream IFN-γ activation site (GAS) and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN-γ directly induced cell death in THP-1 in vitro, while U937 was resistant to IFN-γ induced cell death. Priming of THP-1 with IFN-γ significantly improved the affinity of αHA1-TCR-T to peptide-stimulated THP-1.\n Conclusion: IFN-γ responsiveness of AML blasts was heterogeneous, and cell line data suggest an impact of IFN-γ sensitivity on IFN-γ mediated cell death and alloreactive T cell recognition. Future studies aim to understand the mechanisms underlying IFN-γ sensitivity or resistance in AML, which would help to design clinical trials by selecting the patients who would obtain maximal benefit from IFN-γ therapy in post-transplant relapse (NCT04628338).\n Citation Format: Kedwin Ventura, Iuliia Kovalenko, Jui-En Ray Lee, Biswas Neupane, Daniel Stapor, Sawa Ito.

There are limited randomized data for age-appropriate Rx in older mUC adults. Through our real-world study, we describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes among pts with mUC, comparing older to younger adults receiving 1L systemic Rx. Methods: This retrospective IRB-approved study included pts receiving care between 2014 and 2023 at the University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, a tertiary care National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Eligible pts had a confirmed diagnosis of mUC and received 1L chemotherapy or 1L immunotherapy-based regimens. Based on age at receipt of 1L Rx, pts aged 70 years or above were grouped in the ‘older’ group, while rest were included in the ‘younger’ cohort. Survival and Rx-related outcomes of those enrolled inwere excluded. Overall survival (OS) between the two groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression analysis. All statistical analyses were implemented in R-Studio (v.4.2). Results: We identified 212 eligible mUC pts (103 older vs. 109 younger). Older pts received more immunotherapy-based Rx in the 1L (52.4% vs 35.7%, p=0.02), were more likely to be (73.6% vs. 45.4%, p<0.001), less likely to receive subsequent lines of Rx (median; range: 0 (0-3) vs 1 (0-5), p=0.005) and had lower clinical trial participation (69.9% vs 81.6%, p=0.04)compared to younger pts. For survival outcomes and treatment-related analysis, 160 patients (72 older vs. 88 younger) undergoing approved standard of care were included. Among mUC treated with 1L chemotherapy (n=108), more pts required dose adjustments in older group (23/43 vs 15/65 younger). Older adults received less number of cycles of chemotherapy (median; range: 4 (0-6) vs 5 (1-12), p= 0.03). Older pts had OS comparable to younger pts (11.2 mos vs. 14 mos, p=0.06). Pts from both age groups had similar rates of Rx-related toxicity and healthcare visits, independent of the type of systemic Rx. Conclusions: Older pts with mUC tend to be cis-ineligible and have lower bone marrow reserve. Nevertheless, select pts can be treated with risk-adjusted regimens of chemotherapy and with immunotherapy with comparable outcomes to younger mUC pts in terms of toxicity and outcomes. Validated tools to predict vulnerabilities and excessive chemotherapy-related toxicity in older adults with mUC are available and may help mitigate toxicity by informing Rx adjustments."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have an exceptionally poor prognosis and may not always undergo biopsies for molecular testing, necessitating real-time non-invasive biomarkers of early therapeutic response to ultimately enable timely intervention and improve patient outcomes.\n Methods: We performed targeted error-correction sequencing on serial plasma cell-free DNA (n=139) and matched white blood cell (WBC; n=32) DNA from 33 patients with metastatic SCLC who received treatment with chemotherapy (n=16) or immunotherapy-containing (n=17) regimens. Tumor-derived sequence mutations and plasma aneuploidy were tracked longitudinally using a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach and combined to evaluate changes in total cell-free tumor load (cfTL). Dynamic changes in cfTL were monitored for each patient to determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular response during therapy.\n Results: Longitudinal assessment of cfTL dynamics allowed for the evaluation of molecular response in all patients studied. Overall, 9 patients were classified as molecular responders based on sustained complete elimination of cfTL. For 14 patients, we observed initial molecular responses, followed by cfTL recrudescence. In a subset of 10 patients we observed a distinct pattern of molecular progression characterized by cfTL persistence across all timepoints analyzed. Patients with sustained molecular responses attained longer overall (OS; log-rank p=0.0006) and progression-free (PFS; log-rank p<0.0001) survival, with molecular responses detected on average 4 weeks earlier than imaging. Importantly, ctDNA molecular response remained the most significant predictor of OS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.09, 95% CI=0.02-0.42, p=0.002; molecular response f/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.14, 95% CI=0.04-0.48, p=0.002) and PFS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.02, 95% CI=0.00-0.16, p<0.001; molecular response f/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.05, 95% CI=0.01-0.26, p<0.001) after adjustment for clinical covariates in a multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model. Analysis of landmark OS and PFS endpoints revealed that molecular responses more accurately predicted OS at 12 (AUC 78.1% vs 73.3%) and 64 months (AUC 87.3% vs 67.6%) and PFS at 3 (AUC 91.7% vs 82.0%) and 12 months (AUC 83.5% vs 78.8%) compared to conventional imaging.\n Conclusions: Longitudinal tracking of sequence and structural ctDNA features provide an accurate and rapid approach to track changes in tumor burden and prognosticate outcomes during systemic therapy in patients with SCLC. These findings suggest that therapeutic response monitoring based on combined molecular response criteria may be used to provide guidance on clinical decision making for patients with SCLC.\n Citation Format: Lavanya Sivapalan, Wade T.

    "abstract" : "5606 Background: MMR deficiency (dMMR) is caused by aberrant expression of MMR proteins that mediate DNA repair. The loss can be explained by epigenetic regulation (epi-dMMR; MLH1 promoter hypermethylation preventing MLH-1 expression) or mutation (mut-dMMR; MMR proteins lost through deleterious mutations) accounting for 70%–75% and 25%–30% of dMMR/microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H) EC, respectively. The GARNET trial showed that mechanism of MMR loss did not influence response of EC to monotherapy with dostarlimab (DOST), an anti-PD-1. No data exist examining OS by mechanism of MMR loss in patients (pts) with EC receiving immunotherapy. Here, we report analyses of PFS and OS in pts with primary advanced or recurrent EC (pA/rEC) in Part 1 of the RUBY trial (NCT03981796) by mechanism of MMR protein loss. Methods: Pts with pA/rEC were randomized 1:1 to receive DOST or placebo (PBO), plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP), followed by DOST or PBO monotherapy for up to 3 years. MMR protein status was assessed by immunohistochemistry. MMR loss of function gene mutations were determined by Personalis ImmunoID NeXT whole-exome sequencing assay. MMR protein loss without mutations in MMR genes was a surrogate indicator for epi-dMMR. Post hoc PFS and OS analyses utilized data from the data cut at which each endpoint was met (PFS at Sep 28, 2022; OS at Sep 22, 2023). Results: Part 1 of the RUBY trial included 118 pts with dMMR/MSI-H pA/rEC (DOST+CP = 53; PBO+CP = 65); 39 pts (73.6%) in the DOST+CP arm and 52 pts (80.0%) in the PBO+CP arm had MMR gene mutation data available. Substantial PFS and OS benefits were observed with DOST+CP vs PBO+CP in pts with mut-dMMR or epi-dMMR (Table). No significant differences were seen in PFS or OS in pts with mut-dMMR vs pts with epi-dMMR. Conclusions: DOST+CP led to substantial PFS and OS benefits compared with PBO+CP indMMR/MSI-H pA/rEC, regardless of mechanism of MMR protein loss. A limited number of pts with mut-dMMR treated with DOST+CP were available for analysis; however, the results support that mechanism of MMR loss does not appear to be a significant predictor of clinical benefit for dostarlimab treatment in pts with dMMR pA/rEC in Part 1 of the RUBY trial.

    "abstract" : "Cancer poses a significant challenge to human health due to its complex biological systems, necessitating in-depth analysis. Single-cell sequencing has become an essential tool for investigating these systems, enabling the detection of gene expression and epigenetic modifications at the single-cell level. To elucidate research trends, collaboration networks, and knowledge dissemination in this field, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database, covering publications from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023. The Bibliometrix package in R was used to extract and analyze key publication data, including document types, countries, institutions, authors, and keywords. Additionally, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology were employed for data compilation and visualization. The analysis identified 34,074 authors from 3,129 institutions across 75 countries and regions, contributing to 5,680 publications on single-cell sequencing in cancer, published in 788 academic journals. China and the United States emerged as the leading nations in publication volume. Harvard University produced the highest number of publications (320), with Aviv Regev, affiliated with Harvard, recognized as a key contributor. Leading journals, such as Frontiers in Immunology and Nature Communications, highlight both established and emerging research areas, including the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy. Key trends and potential areas for future research include intra-tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and drug delivery systems. This study provides a comprehensive overview of single-cell sequencing research in oncology, emphasizing its rapid progress, driven by technological advancements and international collaborations. Strengthening global partnerships, developing integrative analytical tools, and addressing data complexities will be crucial for advancing personalized cancer therapies and deepening insights into cancer biology."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they are often associated with severe immune related adverse events (irAEs). These severe irAEs are more often seen in patients with obesity or concomitantly treated with cytotoxic therapies.\n Methods: We aimed to understand the mechanisms of ICB-induced irAEs, in the context of obesity and ICB/chemotherapy combinations. We developed a mouse model of cardiac irAEs, which is the most fatal type of irAE in ICB-treated cancer patients, with clinically relevant features: (i) an ICB-resistant cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or PDAC), (ii) obesity induced with high-fat diets, and (iii) a combination treatment of ICB (α-PD1 + α-CTLA4) and chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX).\n Results: Our FDA and single institution retrospective analyses indicate that patients treated with ICB had greater relative risk of developing myocarditis as compared to other anti-cancer therapies. Mice with orthotopic PDAC and obesity developed irAEs after treatment with ICB and chemotherapy as compared to chow diet. These irAEs recapitulated those observed in patients with cancer and obesity, including cardiac dysfunction consistent with myocarditis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased circulating levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b). IL-1β blockade prevented myocarditis and reduced cardiac fibrosis after immunotherapy. Importantly, IL-1β blockade also enhanced the anti-tumor effects of ICB + FOLFIRINOX combination therapy, and increased mouse survival.\n Conclusions: We developed a translationally relevant 'triple hit' mouse model and discovered that IL-1β mediates ICB-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, we found that IL-1β blockers, which are already used in the clinic for cardiology indications, both reduce adverse events and simultaneously enhance the antitumor effects triggered by immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Nilesh P.

    "abstract" : "T he ABO blood group system, discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1900, is fundamental to the safety of blood transfusion, which requires identification of weak phenotypes or subgroups. The system is composed of two carbohydrate antigens, A and B, and their antibodies. The International Society of Blood Transfusion designates four antigens—A; B; A,B; and A1—based on the specificity of the antibodies. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have clarified the molecular basis of the histo-blood group ABO system. The functional A and B alleles at the ABO genetic locus encode two glycosyltransferases, α-1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A-transferase) and α-1-3-galactosyltransferase (B-transferase), respectively. Initial molecular genetic studies demonstrated that ABO is composed of seven exons spanning approximately 19.5 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1A) and that two critical single-base substitutions in the last coding exon result in amino acid substitutions responsible for the different donor nucleotide-sugar substrate specificity between the Aand B-transferases. A single-base deletion in Exon 6 is considered to shift the reading frame of codons and to abolish the transferase activity of A-transferase in most O alleles. On the other hand, some aspects remain to be explored. The ABO antigens are expressed in a cell type– specific manner; the isoantigens A, B, and H of blood groups A, B, and O are not confined to red blood cells (RBCs) but are also found in most secretions and on some epithelial cells. However, they are absent in connective tissue, muscle, and the central nervous system. Moreover, ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during the development, differentiation, and maturation of cells in the epithelial and erythroid lineages. For example, studies of A-antigen expression during the maturation of erythroid progenitors in a two-phase liquid culture system showed that A-positive cells gradually increased during erythroid maturation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated the expression of A-antigens on colony cells derived from blast-forming units–erythroid and colony-forming units–erythroid. In addition to these physiological processes, profound changes have also been documented in pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of Aor B-antigen expression in bladder and oral cancers has been documented. Moreover, the loss of ABH antigens has been correlated with the progression of various cancers, including lung and bladder carcinomas. Finally, since Yamamoto and colleagues clarified the molecular genetic basis of the ABO system, a number of weak phenotypes have been found to be attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding exons and splicing sites and hybrid formation between common alleles, although other weak phenotypes for which no variant apparently exists in the coding exons and splicing sites have also been reported. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the control of ABO gene expression in a cell type– specific manner, during normal cell differentiation, in cancer cells lacking A or B antigens, and in weak phenotypes, it is essential to grasp how ABO gene transcription is regulated. The DNA sequences in and around specific genes provide the code that dictates when, where, and at what level specific genes are transcribed. This code comprises three parts: the core promoter where RNA production initiates and is directed toward Exon 2, the region proximal to"

    "abstract" : "SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the abnormal function of lymphocytes. The impairment of hematopoietic function of bone marrow participates in its pathogenesis, in which T cells play an important role. However, study on bone marrow T cells in SLE patients is very limited.This study aims to characterize the phenotype and molecular characteristics of abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of SLE patients and explore the mechanism of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reduction caused by the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of patients with SLE.A total of 8 SLE patients and 5 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited in our study. Among them, 3 SLE patients and 4 donors were collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples for Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional studies. BM and peripheral T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokines and secreted immunoglobulins were detected by Luminex. Disease activity of SLE patients was measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). All analyses were performed using R language and Flowjo 9.In the present study, SLE patients had increased CD8+T%αβT cells and decreased CD4+T%αβT cells in bone marrow of SLE, compared to healthy controls. A large number of CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells existed in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of SLE patients. Those patients also showed reduced number of HSCs, and with a downward trend of the numbers of peripheral red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and platelets. By scRNA-seq, the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells contained high levels of GZMK, GZMA, PRF1, IFNG, and TNF in the bone marrow of SLE patients. the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells exhibited significant relationship with HSCs, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets.These findings demonstrated that the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow can reduce the number of HSCs by the expression of killer molecules, which contributes to the impairment of hematopoietic function and the development of SLE. This project focuses on the specific bone marrow T cell subset in SLE.

    "abstract" : "The transcription factor BMAL1 is a core component of the molecular clock, regulating biological pathways that drive 24 h (circadian) rhythms in behaviour and physiology. The molecular clock has a profound influence on innate immune function, and circadian disruption is linked with increased incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. Here we show that BMAL1 and time-of-day regulate the accumulation and activation of various immune cells in a CNS autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In myeloid cells, BMAL1 maintains anti-inflammatory responses and reduces T cell polarization. Loss of myeloid BMAL1 or midday immunizations to induce EAE create an inflammatory environment in the CNS through expansion and infiltration of IL-1β-secreting CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes, resulting in increased pathogenic IL-17+/IFN-γ+ T cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of the molecular clock in modulating innate and adaptive immune crosstalk under autoimmune conditions.Circadian controls of immune responses by the molecular clock have been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here the authors show that the master circadian gene, Bmal1, is essential for modulating the homeostasis of myeloid cells to control pro-inflammatory IL-17+/IFN-γ+ T cells in autoimmunity."

    "abstract" : "The human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus, type I (HTLV-I)-encoded Tax protein is a potent transcription factor and oncoprotein. Therefore, studies on Tax function have provided critical insights into fundamental mechanisms of transcriptional activation and clues to the process of malignant transformation. Biochemical analysis of recombinant, purified Tax has yielded significant insights into many of its diverse functions, despite the absence of potentially important post-translational modifications. We will present evidence demonstrating the potent transcriptional activation function of Tax in vitro, including dissection of the interactions between Tax and specific cellular transcription factors that led to the discovery of Tax-mediated disruptions in chromatin architecture. This presentation will also describe several important findings regarding the molecular defect in Tax M47, which carries point mutations in the activation domain that render the Tax mutant defective for HTLV transcription. Comparison of the physical and functional properties of wild-type and mutant Tax reveals similar profiles in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nearly identical affinity profiles in activator/co activator complex formation; paradoxical observations given the pronounced defect in the ability of Tax M47 to activate HTLV-1 transcription. Importantly, proteolysis assays revealed that TaxM47 produces a distinct digestion pattern relative to wild-type Tax, suggesting that M47 folds into a distinct tertiary structure that is not detected in SEC analysis. Together, these findings further underscore the outstanding potential of native and recombinant Tax to probe the molecular basis of transcriptional activation in higher eukaryotes, as well as the significant potential of Tax in uncovering diverse, yet fundamental, cellular processes."

    "abstract" : "Evidence exists that the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat occurs extracellularly and is involved in the immunosuppression of non-HIV-1-infected T cells of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The mechanism of this immunosuppressive activity of Tat has been controversially discussed. Interestingly, Tat binds to the T cell activation marker CD26, which has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of growth of lymphocytes and to inhibit its dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) activity. Here we show that the N-terminal nonapeptide MDPVDPNIE of Tat is a competitive inhibitor of DP IV and suppresses DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Amino acid exchanges at positions 5 and 6 strongly weaken these effects.1H nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations of Tat(1–9), I5-Tat(1–9), and L6-Tat(1–9) suggest a similar backbone conformation for Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). The solution conformation of I5-Tat(1–9) considerably differs from the other two. However, Tat(1–9) fits into our previously proposed active site model of DP IV in contrast to I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). Conformational alterations with regard to the parent peptide and spatial hindrances between these both compounds and DP IV can explain the loss of inhibitory activity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal residues of HIV-1 Tat do interact directly with the active site of DP IV and that DP IV does mediate Tat’s immunosuppressive effects."

    "abstract" : "Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious neurological disease that largely results in long-term disability and death. Extensive evidence has indicated that the activation of inflammation and ferroptosis significantly contribute to the development of IS pathology. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers associated with IS through the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and to investigate the possible inflammatory and ferroptosis-related molecular mechanisms. Results We identified 178 differentially expressed target messenger RNAs (DETmRNAs) associated with IS. As revealed through enrichment analysis, the DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in the inflammatory signaling pathways and also related to ferroptosis mechanism. The CIBERSORT algorithm showed immune infiltration landscapes in which the naïve B cells, naïve T cells, and monocytes had statistically different numbers in the cerebral infarction group compared with the control group. A ceRNA network was constructed in this study involving 44 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 15 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 160 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify three miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-140-3p, and miR-17-5p), one mRNA (TLR4), and one lncRNA (NEAT1) as the potential key biomarkers of the ceRNA network. The key mRNA and lncRNA were shown to be highly related to the ferroptosis mechanism of IS. The expression of these key biomarkers was also further validated by a method of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in SH-SY5Y cells, and the validated results were consistent with the findings predicted by bioinformatics. Conclusion Our results suggest that the ceRNA network may exert an important role in the inflammatory and ferroptosis molecular mechanisms of IS, providing new insight into therapeutic IS targets."

    "abstract" : "Purpose Regulatory T cells (Tregs) heavily infiltrate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and their accumulation is affected by the metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. In the present study, we sought to identify cancer cell-intrinsic metabolic modulators correlating with Tregs infiltration in TNBC. Experimental design Using the RNA-sequencing data from our institute (n=360) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium TNBC cohort (n=320), we calculated the abundance of Tregs in each sample and evaluated the correlation between gene expression levels and Tregs infiltration. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to verify the correlation and explore the underlying mechanism. Results We revealed that GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) expression was positively correlated with Tregs infiltration and high GCH1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival in TNBC. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that GCH1 increased Tregs infiltration, decreased apoptosis, and elevated the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-positive fraction. Metabolomics analysis indicated that GCH1 overexpression reprogrammed tryptophan metabolism, resulting in L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation in the cytoplasm accompanied by kynurenine accumulation and tryptophan reduction in the supernatant. Subsequently, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, activated by 5-HTP, bound to the promoter of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and thus enhanced the transcription of IDO1. Furthermore, the inhibition of GCH1 by 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) decreased IDO1 expression, attenuated tumor growth, and enhanced the tumor response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. Conclusions Tumor-cell-intrinsic GCH1 induced immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming and IDO1 upregulation in TNBC. Inhibition of GCH1 by DAHP serves as a potential immunometabolic strategy in TNBC."

    "abstract" : "BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. The tumor microenvironment plays a key role in promoting the occurrence of chemoresistance in solid cancers. Effective targets to overcome resistance are necessary to improve the survival and prognosis of CRC patients. This study aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment that might be involved in chemoresistance in patients with CRC.MethodsWe evaluated the effects of CCL20 on chemoresistance of CRC by recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that the level of CCL20 derived from tumor cells was significantly higher in Folfox-resistant patients than in Folfox-sensitive patients. The high level of CCL20 was closely associated with chemoresistance and poor survival in CRC patients. Among the drugs in Folfox chemotherapy, we confirmed that 5-FU increased the expression of CCL20 in CRC. Moreover, CCL20 derived from 5-FU-resistant CRC cells promoted recruitment of Tregs. Tregs further enhanced the chemoresistance of CRC cells to 5-FU. FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB signaling was activated in CRC cells after 5-FU treatment and was required for CCL20 upregulation mediated by 5-FU. Furthermore, CCL20 blockade suppressed tumor progression and restored 5-FU sensitivity in CRC. Lastly, the expression of these signaling molecules mediating chemoresistance was closely correlated with poor survival of CRC patients.ConclusionsCRC cell-secreted CCL20 can recruit Tregs to promote chemoresistance via FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB signaling, indicating that the FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB/CCL20 axis might provide a promising target for CRC treatment."

    "abstract" : "\n About 31,000 new cases of multiple myeloma (MM) will be diagnosed in the US in 2018. In addition to chemotherapeutic agents, several targeted therapies utilizing distinct mechanisms of action, e.g., proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), HDAC inhibitors (panobinostat), Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activators (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), and antibodies (daratumumab, elotuzumab) have become available for treating MM. However, MM remains an incurable disease. Patients who relapse after or are refractory to standard of care treatments generally have poor prognosis. In 2018, close to 13,000 patients will die of the disease in the US. Targeting the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a BAFF/BLyS and APRIL receptor, for treating MM patients can provide a new treatment approach complementary to existing therapies. CAR-T therapies and an antibody-drug conjugate targeting BCMA have demonstrated early clinical success in the treatment of relapsed refractory MM (RRMM).\n HPN217 is a tri-specific T cell activating construct (TriTAC) consisting of three binding domains: an N-terminal single domain antibody (sdAb) that binds to human BCMA, a middle sdAb that binds to human serum albumin (HSA), and a C-terminal single chain Fv (scFv) that binds to CD3ε of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. HPN217 is a highly stable single polypeptide of ~ 53 kDa expressed by CHO cells. Simultaneous engagement of BCMA on a target MM cell and CD3 on a T cell results in T cell activation, functional differentiation and the eventual lysis of the target MM cell. Engineering of an HSA binding domain into HPN217 represents a unique strategy in extending serum half-life, giving the TriTAC molecule a small molecular size and flexibility. This approach is different from Fc-engineering applied in other CD3-based bispecific T cell engaging molecules.\n The KD of HPN217 binding to recombinant human BCMA, HSA, and recombinant human CD3ε was determined to be 5.5 nM, 6 nM, and 17 nM, respectively, as measured by biolayer interferometry. Flow cytometric analysis on a panel of T cells from normal donors and BCMA positive and BCMA negative tumor cell lines confirmed binding of HPN217 to its native targets expressed on cell surface. The in vitro pharmacological activity of HPN217 was evaluated by T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assays. In co-cultures of T cells from normal human or cynomolgus monkey donors, target tumor cells, and HSA, HPN217 mediated dose-dependent and BCMA-dependent cytotoxicity with EC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.7 nM. Killing was dependent on expression of BCMA on target tumor cells. Concomitant with target tumor cell killing, HPN217 also mediated dose-dependent upregulation of CD25 and CD69 on T cells in the TDCC co-cultures when BCMA positive tumor cells were presence. Consistent with the mechanism of action of CD3-based T cell engaging molecules, T cell derived cytokines, e.g., TNFα and IFNγ, were detected. Similar T cell activation could be observed using human or cynomolgus monkey whole blood as a source of T cells.\n Nonclinical in vivo properties of HPN217 were evaluated in xenograft models and a single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study in cynomolgus monkeys. HPN217 mediated dose-dependent growth suppression against the RPMI-8226 MM model and Jeko-1 mantle cell lymphoma model expressing relatively low levels of 5,600 and 2,200 copies of BCMA per cell, respectively. In the PK study, a single dose of HPN217 at 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg was given to cynomolgus monkeys. HPN217 exhibited linear PK behavior over this dose range. Serum half-life was in the range of 64 to 85 hours. Serum half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance appeared to be independent of dose. HPN217 was demonstrated to be stable and remained intact up to 3 weeks in vivo as demonstrated by a functional ligand binding assay using recombinant CD3ε and BCMA, respectively, to capture and detect HPN217. Importantly, serum samples collected one week after dosing were as potent as stock HPN217 in MM tumor cell killing in TDCC assays.\n Collectively, preclinical and nonclinical characterization suggests that HPN217 is an efficacious novel therapeutic candidate that can provide a convenient dosing schedule for patients. A first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial is planned to evaluate HPN217 in RRMM.\n \n \n Law: Harpoon Therapeutics: Employment. Aaron:Harpoon Therapeutics: Employment.

    "abstract" : "The P-STS human ileal neuroendocrine tumor cells, as a model for gut enterochromaffin cells, are strongly and synergistically activated by histamine plus acetylcholine (ACh), presumably via histamine 4 receptors, and weakly activated by histamine alone. Sensing these signals, enterochromaffin cells could participate in intestinal intolerance or allergic reactions to food constituents associated with elevated histamine levels. In this study we aimed to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms. Inhibition by mepyramine and mibefradil indicated that histamine alone caused a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) via histamine 1 receptors involving T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Sensitivity to histamine was enhanced by pretreatment with the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In accordance with the relief it offers some inflammatory bowel disease patients, otilonium bromide, a gut-impermeable inhibitor of T-type (and L-type) VGCCs and muscarinic ACh receptors, efficiently inhibited the [Ca2+]i responses induced by histamine plus ACh or by histamine alone in P-STS cells. It will take clinical studies to show whether otilonium bromide has promise for the treatment of adverse food reactions. The cells did not react to the nutrient constituents glutamate, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, or amylase-trypsin inhibitors and the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 4 agonist GSK-1016790A. The bacterial product butyrate evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i only when added together with ACh. Lipopolysaccharide had no effect on [Ca2+]i despite the presence of Toll-like receptor 4 protein. Our results indicate that inflammatory conditions with elevated levels of TNF-α might enhance histamine-induced serotonin release from intestinal neuroendocrine cells. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that histamine synergistically enhances the intracellular calcium response to the physiological agonist acetylcholine in human ileal enterochromaffin tumor cells. This synergistic activation and cell activation by histamine alone largely depend on T-type voltage-gated calcium channels and are inhibited by the antispasmodic otilonium bromide. The cells showed no response to wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors, suggesting that enterochromaffin cells are not directly involved in nongluten wheat sensitivity."

    "abstract" : "The molecular machinery of apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved with some exceptions. One such example is theDrosophila proapoptotic gene Head involution defective (Hid), whose mammalian homologue is not known. Hid is apoptotic to mammalian cells, and we have examined the mechanism by which Hid induces death. We demonstrate for the first time a role for the extracellular signal-related kinase-1/2 (Erk-1/2) in the regulation of Hid function in mammalian cells. Bcl-2 and an inhibitor of caspase-9 blocked apoptosis, indicative of a role for the mitochondrion in this pathway, and we provide evidence for a role for caspase-8 in Hid-induced apoptosis. Thus, apoptosis was blocked by an inhibitor of caspase-8, deletion of caspase-8 rendered cells resistant to Hid-induced apoptosis, and Hid associated with caspase-8 in cell lysates. The Fas-associated death domain (FADD) was dispensable for the apoptotic function of Hid, indicating that Hid does not require extracellular death receptor signaling for the activation of caspase-8. In activated T cells, the cytokine interleukin-2 blocked caspase-8 processing and apoptosis, suggesting that survival cues from trophic factors may target a Hid-like intermediate present in mammalian cells. Thus, this study shows that Hid engages with conserved components of cellular death machinery and suggests that apoptotic paradigms characterized by FADD-independent activation of caspase-8 may involve a Hid-like molecule in mammalian cells."

    "abstract" : "\n \n Efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies relies on their ability to expand within the recipient. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving this process is difficult to obtain in the autologous setting due to the single-use, patient-derived nature of each infusion product (IP). Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that T cell phenotype in the IP plays a key role. Allogeneic products provide a unique opportunity to distinguish cell-intrinsic from cell-extrinsic mechanisms of CAR T cell expansion as a single lot may be administered to multiple recipients. We hypothesized that the cell-intrinsic molecular characteristics of individual T cell clones in the IP would lead to preferential expansion of some of these clones after infusion.\n We identified patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated on the ALPHA-2 phase 1 trial (NCT04416984) with a single lot of ALLO-501A, a healthy donor-derived CD19 CAR T with T cell receptor (TCR) and CD52 knockout using Cellectis technologies. Among six patients showing robust expansion (median maximum CAR vector copy number 21,571; range 10,296-104,784), peak expansion occurred at day 14 and a high frequency (5/6 = 83%) of clinical responses was observed.\n To understand the nature of the allogeneic CAR T cells expanding in these patients, we performed single-cell (sc) T-cell receptor (TCR)/RNA/surface protein (CITE)-seq on the IP and bulk TCRseq on post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. We identified preferentially expanding T cell clones by comparing the observed post-treatment frequencies and AUCs of each clone with expected values based on their IP frequencies in a first-order kinetic model. Interestingly, identical clones (93.8% CD8+) were observed to preferentially expand and contract in four expanders displaying oligoclonal expansion patterns. Overall, of the top 2000 IP clones, 81 expanding (in at least 3 out of 4 patients) and 27 contracting (in at least 2 out of 4 patients) clones were identified at the p < 0.05 level.\n Of 10 transcriptional states (clusters) identified in the IP CD8+ T-cell scRNA-seq data, we identified one significantly enriched in expanding clones (odds ratio (OR) 5.66; p<1e-15) and three enriched in contracting clones (OR range 2.41-25.71; p<1e-15). Neither the proportion of CAR+ cells (p = 0.52) nor the level of CAR expression (p = 0.48) differed among these states, suggesting that distinct cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs may influence cell fate.\n To elucidate these pathways, we compared the transcriptional profiles of expanding versus contracting clones. We observed that expanding clones exhibited higher expression of effector and differentiation markers including GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, and KLRG1; higher scores for “CD8+ cytotoxicity” (NES = 1.96, FDR = 0.0052), “NK-like activation” (NES = 1.77, FDR = 0.0053), and “effector memory” (Wilcoxon p = 7.35E-5); and lower “central memory” scores (Wilcoxon p < 2.2E-16) than contracting clones. Interestingly, analysis of the donor PBMCs used to generate the IP showed a similar phenotype among these clones, suggesting that this phenotype exists prior to manufacturing and is maintained throughout the manufacturing process.\n In conclusion, we found that identical CD8+ clones exhibiting an effector-like phenotype preferentially expanded in multiple recipients after allogeneic CD19 CAR T cell treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare clonal expansion patterns among recipients of a single lot of allogeneic CAR T cells. The striking similarity of expansion patterns across recipients demonstrates the importance of cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs in driving cell expansion after CAR T cell infusion. Moreover, our data highlight clones with effector-like molecular states as a key subset which could mediate antitumor responses to allogeneic CAR T cell products. These findings, as well as the presence of this phenotype in donor PBMCs prior to manufacturing, carry important implications for future development of these therapies.\n"

    "abstract" : "The Fas/APO-1 Ag, a member of the TNF-R family, mediates apoptosis (programmed cell death, PCD). PCD has been recognized to be important in the regulation of normal and autoimmune responses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully known. To elucidate the role of the Fas Ag in lymphocyte activation, we investigated the influence of Fas Ag cross-linking on CD3/TCR-mediated signal transduction in IL-2-dependent human T cell lines. Early signal transduction events were evaluated in 10-day-old T cell lines using anti-Fas and anti-CD3 mAbs. Incubation of Indo-1-loaded cells with anti-Fas mAb (10 micrograms/ml), but not with an isotypic control mAb almost completely inhibited the anti-CD3-mediated Ca2+ influx. This inhibition was mAb concentration dependent and was detected after incubation for at least 15 min. Cross-linking of the Fas Ag did not affect the anti-CD3-mediated release of Ca2+ from the internal stores or the thapsigargin-mediated Ca2+ influx. Anti-Fas mAb-incubated cells also showed decreased CD3-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. Preincubation of cells with anti-Fas mAb inhibited the anti-CD3-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins. Cross-linking of the Fas Ag for up to 6 h did not alter the expression of CD3 on the surface of the T cells. Preincubation of Indo-1-loaded EBV-transformed B cells with anti-Fas mAb did not affect the anti-mu Ab-induced increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Our results show that cross-linking of the Fas Ag can suppress the receptor-mediated signaling process in human T but not B cells."

    "abstract" : "Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific field that promotes the standardized manufacturing of biological components without natural equivalents. Its goal is to create artificial living systems that can meet various needs in health care, nanotechnology and energy. Most works are currently focused on the individual bacterium as a chemical reactor. Our project, SynBioTIC, addresses a novel and more complex challenge: shape engineering, i.e. the redesign of natural morphogenesis toward a new kind of \" developmental 3D printing \". Potential applications include organ growth, natural computing in biocircuits, or future vegetal houses. Using realistic agent-based simulations of bacterial mats, we experiment with mechanisms allowing cell assemblies to collectively self-repair and develop complex structures. To create multicellular organisms that exhibit specific shapes (a completely original task) we construe their development iteratively by combining basic processes such as homeostasis, segmentation, and controlled proliferation in silico. We use the E. coli simulator Gro 1 , a physico-chemical computation platform offering reaction-diffusion and collision dynamics solvers. The synthetic \" bioware \" of our model executes a set of rules, or \" genome \" , in each cell. Cells can differentiate into several predefined types associated with specific actions (divide, tumble, emit signal, die, etc.). Transitions between types are triggered by conditions involving internal and external sensors that detect various protein levels inside and around the cell. There is no direct molecular signaling between two neighboring bacteria, only indirect communication via morphogen diffusion and the mechanical constraints of 2D packing. In any case, the overall architecture emerges in a purely endogenous fashion. For now, cell behaviors are set by rules hand-coded in the Gro script language. Starting from a single bacterium, our artificial creatures execute a series of developmental stages. First, isotropic proliferation produces a roughly circular population characterized by homeostatic activity (black and white cores in Fig. 1a,b). This is based on leader cells emitting a morphogen, while other cells continually divide and die at the periphery where the morphogen concentra-1 Jang, Oishi, Egbert & Klavins (2012) ACS Syn Biol, 1:365–74.

Each cell also contains an oscillatory mechanism acting like a internal clock. In the crown, these oscillators are synchronized, i.e. characterized by a uniform phase. At this stage, a new wave of morphogen is triggered by a randomly activated cell on the crown, and rapidly propagates (suppressing any competitor wave). The encounter between the wave front and the current state of the oscillator determines whether each cell differentiates, and into what type. The period of oscillations controls the number of segments that can appear. Finally, precursor cells emerge at the periphery of these segments and stimulate new local proliferation , which eventually triggers limb growth in a way similar to the apical meristem of plant shoots (Fig. 1c). Applying this mechanism to two segments and two precursors , North and South, then on the equator that they form (areas of equal morphogen concentration), the system gives rise to a second pair, East and West, i.e. four differentiated seeds in total. This makes it possible to control the growth and features of single appendages. The L and T shapes of Fig. 1 exemplify this \" divergence of homology \" : some precursors are inhibited while others create limbs of varying size. Such morphogenetic phenotypes allow us to envision more complex shapes made of an array of cores and limbs, by iterating the above processes. Most importantly, they open the door to an evolutionary (\" evo-devo \") exploration."

    "abstract" : "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis initially isolated in 1902 from a tuberculous cow (1). This isolate was cultured for 13 years until it lost its virulence and was developed into a vaccine by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerín in 1921 at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France. It is the only available vaccine to fight tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections as leprosy and Buruli ulcer disease (2,3). All the BCG substrains currently in use derive from the original strain produced, distributed to several countries. Currently, the main substrains are the Brazilian (Moreau/Rio de Janeiro), Danish (Copenhagen – 1331), Japanese (Tokyo – 172-1), Russian (Moscow – 368), and Bulgarian (Sofia – SL222). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended BCG vaccination since 1948 and recognized the Brazilian Moreau-RJ as a reference strain in 2012, along with the Russian, Danish, and Japanese strains (3, 4). During the 1970s, the Canadian urologist Alvaro Morales have studied BCG for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (5). Since then, intravesical BCG is still the most effective treatment, along with transurethral resection, to avoid NMIBC recurrence. According to all international guidelines, it is recommended as first-line therapy for NMIBC, as it reduces to almost half the recurrence rates (6-8). In addition to proven efficacy as a vaccine on genitourinary oncology, BCG is still the target for molecular and cellular research since the mechanisms activated by vaccination are complex, involving at least two responses: T cells antigen-specific and memory (classic adaptive immunity), and “trained” immunity (epigenetic reprogramming) mediated by innate immune cells (9, 10). This reprogramming occurs at the histone methylation level, inducing persistent conformational changes of chromatin in a mononuclear cell, exhibiting a long-lasting phenotype after vaccination with the ability to mediate specific and nonspecific protection against other infections, leading to a robust and faster immune response compared to adaptive immunity (9-12).

    "abstract" : "Background Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the major contributors to short-term graft function. Dissecting organ specific pathways and common molecular pathways associated with I/R injury among different organ types will help in better designing of specific therapeutic interventions. It will also help in understanding tissue specific injury and recovery mechanisms following early I/R injury. Methods 120 Gene expression (Affymetrix HG-U133Av2 Gene Chips) arrays were performed on allograft biopsies obtained from deceased donor kidney transplant recipients (n = 30) and liver transplant recipients (LTRs) (n = 30). From each patient, pre-implantation (PI) and post-reperfusion (PR) biopsies were obtained. Gene expression analysis was done using expression and transcriptome console softwares. PI and PR gene expression was compared in liver and kidney biopsies separately and probe sets were considered significant when the false discovery rate (FDR) was < 5 % and fold change greater than 1.5. IPA software and other gene enrichment and cell type enrichment softwares were used for further analysis of the data. Results Comparing gene expression in PI and PR biopsies from LTRs resulted in 438 probe sets and similar analysis in KTRs yielded 366 differentially expressed probe sets. Upon comparing the early I/R response in Liver and Kidney, it was observed that 40 – 50 % of the differentially expressed genes were similar in both organs and these genes were mainly involved in inflammatory pathways and transcription regulation. Around 28% of the common genes were transcription factors and around 12% were cytokines and growth factors. Among the top common pathways were IL6 signaling pathway, NF-KB signaling, HMGB1 signaling, and production of NO and ROS in macrophages. However, the main differences associated with liver specific I/R response genes involving growth factors and cytokines that relate to wound healing and additional reparative processes like angiogenesis. Also, additional molecular pathways involved in functions like T cell development, lymphopoiesis and response of neutrophils were exacerbated in the liver tissues. Otherwise, in kidney tissues undergoing I/R the initial unique molecular pathways were those involved in inhibition of growth of connective tissue Conclusion We identified common intra-allograft inflammatory responses to I/R injury between kidney and liver transplantation. However, liver grafts presented a faster activation of molecular profiles associated with regenerative, reparative and growth factors related functions."

Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell hyperactivity will lead to identification of specific therapeutic targets. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF)1 is an essential RNA-binding protein which controls posttranscriptional gene expression. We have demonstrated that SRSF1 levels are aberrantly decreased in T cells from SLE patients and correlate with severe disease, yet the role of SRSF1 in T cell physiology and autoimmune disease is largely unknown. Here we show that T cell-restricted Srsf1-deficient mice develop systemic autoimmunity and lupus-nephritis. Mice exhibit increased frequencies of activated/effector T cells producing proinflammatory cytokines, and an elevated T cell activation gene signature. Mechanistically, we noted increased activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and reduced expression of its repressor PTEN. The mTOR complex (mTORC)1 inhibitor rapamycin suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells and alleviated autoimmunity in Srsf1-deficient mice. Of direct clinical relevance, PTEN levels correlated with SRSF1 in T cells from SLE patients, and SRSF1 overexpression rescued PTEN, suppressed mTORC1 activation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Our studies reveal the role of a previously unrecognized molecule SRSF1 in restraining T cell activation and averting the development of autoimmune disease and a potential therapeutic target for lupus."

    "abstract" : "Background Th17 cells are central pathogenic mediators of autoimmune disease, including many forms of GN. IL-10 receptor signaling (IL-10R) in regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been implicated in the downregulation of Th17 cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of this process remain unclear.Methods We generated mice with Treg-specific IL-10Ra deficiency and subjected these mice to nephrotoxic serum-induced nephritis as a model of crescentic GN. Immune responses and Treg phenotypes were extensively analyzed.Results Compared with controls, mice with IL-10Ra-/- Tregs showed a spontaneously overshooting Th17 immune response. This hyper-Th17 phenotype was further boosted during GN and associated with aggravated renal injury. Notably, abrogation of IL-10Ra signaling in Tregs increased dendritic cell activation and production of Th17-inducing cytokines. In contrast, Treg trafficking and expression of chemokine receptor CCR6 remained unaffected, indicating mechanisms of Th17 control, differing from those of previously identified CCR6+ Treg17 cells. Indeed, the capacity for direct in vitro suppression of Th17 responses by IL-10Ra-/- Tregs was significantly impaired. As underlying pathology, analyses conducted in vitro and in vivo using double-fluorescent reporter mice revealed strikingly decreased IL-10 production by IL-10Ra-/- Tregs. To assess, whether reduced IL-10 could explain the hyper Th17 phenotype, competitive cotransfer experiments were performed. Supporting our concept, IL-10Ra-/- T cells differentiated into Th17 cells at much higher frequencies than wild type T cells did during GN.Conclusions IL-10R engagement optimizes Treg-mediated suppression of Th17 immunity. We hypothesize a feed-forward loop, in which IL-10Ra signaling reinforces IL-10 secretion by Tregs which potently controls Th17 development via direct and indirect mechanisms. IL-10R thus may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of GN."

Clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA into the tumor genome with persistent expression of viral T antigens causes at least 60% of all MCC. UV damage leading to highly mutated genomes causes a nonviral form of MCC. Despite these distinct etiologies, both forms of MCC are similar in presentation, prognosis, and response to therapy. At least three oncogenic transcriptional programs feature prominently in both forms of MCC driven by the virus or by mutation. Both forms of MCC have a high proliferative growth rate with increased levels of cell cycle-dependent genes due to inactivation of the tumor suppressors RB and p53, a strong MYC signature due to MYCL activation by the virus or gene amplification, and an attenuated neuroendocrine differentiation program driven by the ATOH1 transcription factor.

    "abstract" : "Autoantibodies, once considered mere biomarkers of autoimmune disorders, are now recognized as central players in disease pathogenesis, offering critical insights into the breakdown of immune tolerance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the dual roles of autoantibodies—as diagnostic tools and direct mediators of tissue damage—across a spectrum of autoimmune diseases. We begin by exploring the mechanisms underlying autoantibody production, including genetic predispositions (e.g., HLA haplotypes), environmental triggers (infections, microbiome dysbiosis), and dysregulated B-cell/T-cell interactions. Pathogenic mechanisms are dissected, from complement activation and immune complex deposition to receptor blockade/activation (e.g., anti-TSH receptor in Graves’ disease) and molecular mimicry.\nHighlighting disease-specific autoantibodies, we detail their clinical implications in systemic lupus erythematosus (anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith), rheumatoid arthritis (anti-CCP), and neurological disorders (anti-NMDA receptor, anti-AQP4). The review underscores the diagnostic and prognostic utility of autoantibodies, while addressing challenges such as seronegative autoimmunity and assay variability. Current therapeutic strategies, including B-cell depletion (rituximab), complement inhibition (eculizumab), and cytokine modulation, are evaluated alongside emerging approaches like antigen-specific tolerance induction and CAR-T cell therapy.\nUnresolved questions—such as why some autoantibodies remain asymptomatic and their role in disease initiation—are discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research. Advances in single-cell technologies, proteomics, and AI-driven diagnostics promise to revolutionize personalized medicine, enabling early intervention and tailored therapies. By bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications, this review underscores the transformative potential of autoantibody research in redefining autoimmune disease management and moving toward curative strategies."

    "abstract" : "Chemical-induced oxidative stress to a cell can signal many cellular responses which include proliferation, differentiation, hemeostasis, apoptosis or necrosis. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms after exposure to chemicals, we investigated the signal transduction pathways, in particular the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the ICE/Ced-3 protease (caspase) pathway, activated by different agents. Butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) and its metabolite, t-butyl-hydroquinone (tBHQ), both are well known phenolic antioxidants used in food preservatives, strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and/or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with free radical scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH), or vitamin E, inhibited ERK2 activation and, to a much lesser extent, JNK 1 activation by BHA and tBHQ, implicating the role of oxidative stress. Under conditions where JNK1 and ERK2 were activated, BHA also activated transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B), activated-protein-1 (AP-1), and anti-oxidant response element (ARE), leading to induction of genes such as c-jun, and c-fos. At relatively high concentrations, BHA and tBHQ stimulated proteolytic activity of ICE/Ced3 cysteine proteases, and caused apoptosis, which was blocked by pretreatment with NAC. Further increase in concentrations lead to rapid cell death predominantly occurred via necrosis. Some naturally occurring phytochemicals, such as phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), green tea polyphenols (GTP), and sulfarophane, which have been shown to be potent inducers of Phase II enzymes, also differentially regulated the activities of JNK, ERK, or CPP-32, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our data, together with the work of others, enable us to propose a model in which low concentrations of these chemicals (e.g., BHA, PEITC) activate MAPKs leading to induction of gene expression (e.g., c-jun, c-fos, GSI) which may protect the cells against toxic insults and enhance cell survival. At relatively high concentrations, these agents activated both MAPKS, and the ICE/Ced-3 caspase pathway, leading to apoptosis. The exact mechanisms by which MAPK and caspases are activated by these agents are currently unknown, but may involve oxidative modification of glutathione (GSH) and/or protein thiols, and/or generation of secondary messengers, ceramide and calcium, which further activate downstream events. Taken together, our results suggest that chemicals including phenolic antioxidants activate MAPK pathways which may lead to the induction of genes producing protection and survival mechanisms, as well as the ICE/Ced-3 protease pathway, leading to apoptosis. The balancing amongst these pathways may dictate the fate of the cells upon exposure to chemicals."

In addition, activated T cells release membrane microvesicles called exosomes during these regulatory processes. In this review, we revise the role of exosome secretion in the different pathways of immune regulation described to date and its importance in the prevention or development of autoimmune disease.

    "abstract" : "T he ABO blood group system, discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1900, is fundamental to the safety of blood transfusion, which requires identification of weak phenotypes or subgroups. The system is composed of two carbohydrate antigens, A and B, and their antibodies. The International Society of Blood Transfusion designates four antigens—A; B; A,B; and A1—based on the specificity of the antibodies. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have clarified the molecular basis of the histo-blood group ABO system. The functional A and B alleles at the ABO genetic locus encode two glycosyltransferases, α-1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A-transferase) and α-1-3-galactosyltransferase (B-transferase), respectively. Initial molecular genetic studies demonstrated that ABO is composed of seven exons spanning approximately 19.5 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1A) and that two critical single-base substitutions in the last coding exon result in amino acid substitutions responsible for the different donor nucleotide-sugar substrate specificity between the Aand B-transferases. A single-base deletion in Exon 6 is considered to shift the reading frame of codons and to abolish the transferase activity of A-transferase in most O alleles. On the other hand, some aspects remain to be explored. The ABO antigens are expressed in a cell type– specific manner; the isoantigens A, B, and H of blood groups A, B, and O are not confined to red blood cells (RBCs) but are also found in most secretions and on some epithelial cells. However, they are absent in connective tissue, muscle, and the central nervous system. Moreover, ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during the development, differentiation, and maturation of cells in the epithelial and erythroid lineages. For example, studies of A-antigen expression during the maturation of erythroid progenitors in a two-phase liquid culture system showed that A-positive cells gradually increased during erythroid maturation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated the expression of A-antigens on colony cells derived from blast-forming units–erythroid and colony-forming units–erythroid. In addition to these physiological processes, profound changes have also been documented in pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of Aor B-antigen expression in bladder and oral cancers has been documented. Moreover, the loss of ABH antigens has been correlated with the progression of various cancers, including lung and bladder carcinomas. Finally, since Yamamoto and colleagues clarified the molecular genetic basis of the ABO system, a number of weak phenotypes have been found to be attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding exons and splicing sites and hybrid formation between common alleles, although other weak phenotypes for which no variant apparently exists in the coding exons and splicing sites have also been reported. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the control of ABO gene expression in a cell type– specific manner, during normal cell differentiation, in cancer cells lacking A or B antigens, and in weak phenotypes, it is essential to grasp how ABO gene transcription is regulated. The DNA sequences in and around specific genes provide the code that dictates when, where, and at what level specific genes are transcribed.

    "abstract" : "SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the abnormal function of lymphocytes. The impairment of hematopoietic function of bone marrow participates in its pathogenesis, in which T cells play an important role. However, study on bone marrow T cells in SLE patients is very limited.This study aims to characterize the phenotype and molecular characteristics of abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of SLE patients and explore the mechanism of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reduction caused by the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of patients with SLE.A total of 8 SLE patients and 5 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited in our study. Among them, 3 SLE patients and 4 donors were collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples for Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional studies. BM and peripheral T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokines and secreted immunoglobulins were detected by Luminex. Disease activity of SLE patients was measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). All analyses were performed using R language and Flowjo 9.In the present study, SLE patients had increased CD8+T%αβT cells and decreased CD4+T%αβT cells in bone marrow of SLE, compared to healthy controls. A large number of CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells existed in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of SLE patients. Those patients also showed reduced number of HSCs, and with a downward trend of the numbers of peripheral red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and platelets. By scRNA-seq, the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells contained high levels of GZMK, GZMA, PRF1, IFNG, and TNF in the bone marrow of SLE patients. the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells exhibited significant relationship with HSCs, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets.These findings demonstrated that the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow can reduce the number of HSCs by the expression of killer molecules, which contributes to the impairment of hematopoietic function and the development of SLE. This project focuses on the specific bone marrow T cell subset in SLE. The completement of this project provides information for exploring the mechanism of hematopoiesis involvement.[1]Anderson E, Shah B, Davidson A, Furie R.

    "abstract" : "The transcription factor BMAL1 is a core component of the molecular clock, regulating biological pathways that drive 24 h (circadian) rhythms in behaviour and physiology. The molecular clock has a profound influence on innate immune function, and circadian disruption is linked with increased incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. Here we show that BMAL1 and time-of-day regulate the accumulation and activation of various immune cells in a CNS autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In myeloid cells, BMAL1 maintains anti-inflammatory responses and reduces T cell polarization. Loss of myeloid BMAL1 or midday immunizations to induce EAE create an inflammatory environment in the CNS through expansion and infiltration of IL-1β-secreting CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes, resulting in increased pathogenic IL-17+/IFN-γ+ T cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of the molecular clock in modulating innate and adaptive immune crosstalk under autoimmune conditions.Circadian controls of immune responses by the molecular clock have been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here the authors show that the master circadian gene, Bmal1, is essential for modulating the homeostasis of myeloid cells to control pro-inflammatory IL-17+/IFN-γ+ T cells in autoimmunity."

    "abstract" : "The human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus, type I (HTLV-I)-encoded Tax protein is a potent transcription factor and oncoprotein. Therefore, studies on Tax function have provided critical insights into fundamental mechanisms of transcriptional activation and clues to the process of malignant transformation. Biochemical analysis of recombinant, purified Tax has yielded significant insights into many of its diverse functions, despite the absence of potentially important post-translational modifications. We will present evidence demonstrating the potent transcriptional activation function of Tax in vitro, including dissection of the interactions between Tax and specific cellular transcription factors that led to the discovery of Tax-mediated disruptions in chromatin architecture. This presentation will also describe several important findings regarding the molecular defect in Tax M47, which carries point mutations in the activation domain that render the Tax mutant defective for HTLV transcription. Comparison of the physical and functional properties of wild-type and mutant Tax reveals similar profiles in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nearly identical affinity profiles in activator/co activator complex formation; paradoxical observations given the pronounced defect in the ability of Tax M47 to activate HTLV-1 transcription. Importantly, proteolysis assays revealed that TaxM47 produces a distinct digestion pattern relative to wild-type Tax, suggesting that M47 folds into a distinct tertiary structure that is not detected in SEC analysis. Together, these findings further underscore the outstanding potential of native and recombinant Tax to probe the molecular basis of transcriptional activation in higher eukaryotes, as well as the significant potential of Tax in uncovering diverse, yet fundamental, cellular processes."

    "abstract" : "Evidence exists that the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivator Tat occurs extracellularly and is involved in the immunosuppression of non-HIV-1-infected T cells of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The mechanism of this immunosuppressive activity of Tat has been controversially discussed. Interestingly, Tat binds to the T cell activation marker CD26, which has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of growth of lymphocytes and to inhibit its dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) activity. Here we show that the N-terminal nonapeptide MDPVDPNIE of Tat is a competitive inhibitor of DP IV and suppresses DNA synthesis of tetanus toxoid-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Amino acid exchanges at positions 5 and 6 strongly weaken these effects.1H nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations of Tat(1–9), I5-Tat(1–9), and L6-Tat(1–9) suggest a similar backbone conformation for Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). The solution conformation of I5-Tat(1–9) considerably differs from the other two. However, Tat(1–9) fits into our previously proposed active site model of DP IV in contrast to I5-Tat(1–9) and L6-Tat(1–9). Conformational alterations with regard to the parent peptide and spatial hindrances between these both compounds and DP IV can explain the loss of inhibitory activity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal residues of HIV-1 Tat do interact directly with the active site of DP IV and that DP IV does mediate Tat’s immunosuppressive effects."

    "abstract" : "Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious neurological disease that largely results in long-term disability and death. Extensive evidence has indicated that the activation of inflammation and ferroptosis significantly contribute to the development of IS pathology. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers associated with IS through the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and to investigate the possible inflammatory and ferroptosis-related molecular mechanisms. Results We identified 178 differentially expressed target messenger RNAs (DETmRNAs) associated with IS. As revealed through enrichment analysis, the DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in the inflammatory signaling pathways and also related to ferroptosis mechanism. The CIBERSORT algorithm showed immune infiltration landscapes in which the naïve B cells, naïve T cells, and monocytes had statistically different numbers in the cerebral infarction group compared with the control group. A ceRNA network was constructed in this study involving 44 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 15 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 160 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify three miRNAs (miR-103a-3p, miR-140-3p, and miR-17-5p), one mRNA (TLR4), and one lncRNA (NEAT1) as the potential key biomarkers of the ceRNA network. The key mRNA and lncRNA were shown to be highly related to the ferroptosis mechanism of IS. The expression of these key biomarkers was also further validated by a method of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in SH-SY5Y cells, and the validated results were consistent with the findings predicted by bioinformatics. Conclusion Our results suggest that the ceRNA network may exert an important role in the inflammatory and ferroptosis molecular mechanisms of IS, providing new insight into therapeutic IS targets."

    "abstract" : "Purpose Regulatory T cells (Tregs) heavily infiltrate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and their accumulation is affected by the metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. In the present study, we sought to identify cancer cell-intrinsic metabolic modulators correlating with Tregs infiltration in TNBC. Experimental design Using the RNA-sequencing data from our institute (n=360) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium TNBC cohort (n=320), we calculated the abundance of Tregs in each sample and evaluated the correlation between gene expression levels and Tregs infiltration. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to verify the correlation and explore the underlying mechanism. Results We revealed that GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) expression was positively correlated with Tregs infiltration and high GCH1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival in TNBC. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that GCH1 increased Tregs infiltration, decreased apoptosis, and elevated the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-positive fraction. Metabolomics analysis indicated that GCH1 overexpression reprogrammed tryptophan metabolism, resulting in L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation in the cytoplasm accompanied by kynurenine accumulation and tryptophan reduction in the supernatant. Subsequently, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, activated by 5-HTP, bound to the promoter of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and thus enhanced the transcription of IDO1. Furthermore, the inhibition of GCH1 by 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) decreased IDO1 expression, attenuated tumor growth, and enhanced the tumor response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. Conclusions Tumor-cell-intrinsic GCH1 induced immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming and IDO1 upregulation in TNBC. Inhibition of GCH1 by DAHP serves as a potential immunometabolic strategy in TNBC."

    "abstract" : "BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. The tumor microenvironment plays a key role in promoting the occurrence of chemoresistance in solid cancers. Effective targets to overcome resistance are necessary to improve the survival and prognosis of CRC patients. This study aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment that might be involved in chemoresistance in patients with CRC.MethodsWe evaluated the effects of CCL20 on chemoresistance of CRC by recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that the level of CCL20 derived from tumor cells was significantly higher in Folfox-resistant patients than in Folfox-sensitive patients. The high level of CCL20 was closely associated with chemoresistance and poor survival in CRC patients. Among the drugs in Folfox chemotherapy, we confirmed that 5-FU increased the expression of CCL20 in CRC. Moreover, CCL20 derived from 5-FU-resistant CRC cells promoted recruitment of Tregs. Tregs further enhanced the chemoresistance of CRC cells to 5-FU. FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB signaling was activated in CRC cells after 5-FU treatment and was required for CCL20 upregulation mediated by 5-FU. Furthermore, CCL20 blockade suppressed tumor progression and restored 5-FU sensitivity in CRC. Lastly, the expression of these signaling molecules mediating chemoresistance was closely correlated with poor survival of CRC patients.ConclusionsCRC cell-secreted CCL20 can recruit Tregs to promote chemoresistance via FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB signaling, indicating that the FOXO1/CEBPB/NF-κB/CCL20 axis might provide a promising target for CRC treatment."

    "abstract" : "\n About 31,000 new cases of multiple myeloma (MM) will be diagnosed in the US in 2018. In addition to chemotherapeutic agents, several targeted therapies utilizing distinct mechanisms of action, e.g., proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), HDAC inhibitors (panobinostat), Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activators (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), and antibodies (daratumumab, elotuzumab) have become available for treating MM. However, MM remains an incurable disease. Patients who relapse after or are refractory to standard of care treatments generally have poor prognosis. In 2018, close to 13,000 patients will die of the disease in the US. Targeting the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a BAFF/BLyS and APRIL receptor, for treating MM patients can provide a new treatment approach complementary to existing therapies. CAR-T therapies and an antibody-drug conjugate targeting BCMA have demonstrated early clinical success in the treatment of relapsed refractory MM (RRMM).\n HPN217 is a tri-specific T cell activating construct (TriTAC) consisting of three binding domains: an N-terminal single domain antibody (sdAb) that binds to human BCMA, a middle sdAb that binds to human serum albumin (HSA), and a C-terminal single chain Fv (scFv) that binds to CD3ε of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. HPN217 is a highly stable single polypeptide of ~ 53 kDa expressed by CHO cells. Simultaneous engagement of BCMA on a target MM cell and CD3 on a T cell results in T cell activation, functional differentiation and the eventual lysis of the target MM cell. Engineering of an HSA binding domain into HPN217 represents a unique strategy in extending serum half-life, giving the TriTAC molecule a small molecular size and flexibility. This approach is different from Fc-engineering applied in other CD3-based bispecific T cell engaging molecules.\n The KD of HPN217 binding to recombinant human BCMA, HSA, and recombinant human CD3ε was determined to be 5.5 nM, 6 nM, and 17 nM, respectively, as measured by biolayer interferometry. Flow cytometric analysis on a panel of T cells from normal donors and BCMA positive and BCMA negative tumor cell lines confirmed binding of HPN217 to its native targets expressed on cell surface. The in vitro pharmacological activity of HPN217 was evaluated by T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assays. In co-cultures of T cells from normal human or cynomolgus monkey donors, target tumor cells, and HSA, HPN217 mediated dose-dependent and BCMA-dependent cytotoxicity with EC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.7 nM. Killing was dependent on expression of BCMA on target tumor cells. Concomitant with target tumor cell killing, HPN217 also mediated dose-dependent upregulation of CD25 and CD69 on T cells in the TDCC co-cultures when BCMA positive tumor cells were presence. Consistent with the mechanism of action of CD3-based T cell engaging molecules, T cell derived cytokines, e.g., TNFα and IFNγ, were detected. Similar T cell activation could be observed using human or cynomolgus monkey whole blood as a source of T cells.\n Nonclinical in vivo properties of HPN217 were evaluated in xenograft models and a single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study in cynomolgus monkeys. HPN217 mediated dose-dependent growth suppression against the RPMI-8226 MM model and Jeko-1 mantle cell lymphoma model expressing relatively low levels of 5,600 and 2,200 copies of BCMA per cell, respectively. In the PK study, a single dose of HPN217 at 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg was given to cynomolgus monkeys. HPN217 exhibited linear PK behavior over this dose range. Serum half-life was in the range of 64 to 85 hours. Serum half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance appeared to be independent of dose. HPN217 was demonstrated to be stable and remained intact up to 3 weeks in vivo as demonstrated by a functional ligand binding assay using recombinant CD3ε and BCMA, respectively, to capture and detect HPN217. Importantly, serum samples collected one week after dosing were as potent as stock HPN217 in MM tumor cell killing in TDCC assays.\n Collectively, preclinical and nonclinical characterization suggests that HPN217 is an efficacious novel therapeutic candidate that can provide a convenient dosing schedule for patients. A first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial is planned to evaluate HPN217 in RRMM.\n \n \n Law: Harpoon Therapeutics: Employment. Aaron:Harpoon Therapeutics: Employment.

    "abstract" : "The P-STS human ileal neuroendocrine tumor cells, as a model for gut enterochromaffin cells, are strongly and synergistically activated by histamine plus acetylcholine (ACh), presumably via histamine 4 receptors, and weakly activated by histamine alone. Sensing these signals, enterochromaffin cells could participate in intestinal intolerance or allergic reactions to food constituents associated with elevated histamine levels. In this study we aimed to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms. Inhibition by mepyramine and mibefradil indicated that histamine alone caused a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) via histamine 1 receptors involving T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Sensitivity to histamine was enhanced by pretreatment with the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In accordance with the relief it offers some inflammatory bowel disease patients, otilonium bromide, a gut-impermeable inhibitor of T-type (and L-type) VGCCs and muscarinic ACh receptors, efficiently inhibited the [Ca2+]i responses induced by histamine plus ACh or by histamine alone in P-STS cells. It will take clinical studies to show whether otilonium bromide has promise for the treatment of adverse food reactions. The cells did not react to the nutrient constituents glutamate, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, or amylase-trypsin inhibitors and the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 4 agonist GSK-1016790A. The bacterial product butyrate evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i only when added together with ACh. Lipopolysaccharide had no effect on [Ca2+]i despite the presence of Toll-like receptor 4 protein. Our results indicate that inflammatory conditions with elevated levels of TNF-α might enhance histamine-induced serotonin release from intestinal neuroendocrine cells. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that histamine synergistically enhances the intracellular calcium response to the physiological agonist acetylcholine in human ileal enterochromaffin tumor cells. This synergistic activation and cell activation by histamine alone largely depend on T-type voltage-gated calcium channels and are inhibited by the antispasmodic otilonium bromide. The cells showed no response to wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors, suggesting that enterochromaffin cells are not directly involved in nongluten wheat sensitivity."

    "abstract" : "The molecular machinery of apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved with some exceptions. One such example is theDrosophila proapoptotic gene Head involution defective (Hid), whose mammalian homologue is not known. Hid is apoptotic to mammalian cells, and we have examined the mechanism by which Hid induces death. We demonstrate for the first time a role for the extracellular signal-related kinase-1/2 (Erk-1/2) in the regulation of Hid function in mammalian cells. Bcl-2 and an inhibitor of caspase-9 blocked apoptosis, indicative of a role for the mitochondrion in this pathway, and we provide evidence for a role for caspase-8 in Hid-induced apoptosis. Thus, apoptosis was blocked by an inhibitor of caspase-8, deletion of caspase-8 rendered cells resistant to Hid-induced apoptosis, and Hid associated with caspase-8 in cell lysates. The Fas-associated death domain (FADD) was dispensable for the apoptotic function of Hid, indicating that Hid does not require extracellular death receptor signaling for the activation of caspase-8. In activated T cells, the cytokine interleukin-2 blocked caspase-8 processing and apoptosis, suggesting that survival cues from trophic factors may target a Hid-like intermediate present in mammalian cells. Thus, this study shows that Hid engages with conserved components of cellular death machinery and suggests that apoptotic paradigms characterized by FADD-independent activation of caspase-8 may involve a Hid-like molecule in mammalian cells."

    "abstract" : "\n \n Efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies relies on their ability to expand within the recipient. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving this process is difficult to obtain in the autologous setting due to the single-use, patient-derived nature of each infusion product (IP). Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that T cell phenotype in the IP plays a key role. Allogeneic products provide a unique opportunity to distinguish cell-intrinsic from cell-extrinsic mechanisms of CAR T cell expansion as a single lot may be administered to multiple recipients. We hypothesized that the cell-intrinsic molecular characteristics of individual T cell clones in the IP would lead to preferential expansion of some of these clones after infusion.\n We identified patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated on the ALPHA-2 phase 1 trial (NCT04416984) with a single lot of ALLO-501A, a healthy donor-derived CD19 CAR T with T cell receptor (TCR) and CD52 knockout using Cellectis technologies. Among six patients showing robust expansion (median maximum CAR vector copy number 21,571; range 10,296-104,784), peak expansion occurred at day 14 and a high frequency (5/6 = 83%) of clinical responses was observed.\n To understand the nature of the allogeneic CAR T cells expanding in these patients, we performed single-cell (sc) T-cell receptor (TCR)/RNA/surface protein (CITE)-seq on the IP and bulk TCRseq on post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. We identified preferentially expanding T cell clones by comparing the observed post-treatment frequencies and AUCs of each clone with expected values based on their IP frequencies in a first-order kinetic model. Interestingly, identical clones (93.8% CD8+) were observed to preferentially expand and contract in four expanders displaying oligoclonal expansion patterns. Overall, of the top 2000 IP clones, 81 expanding (in at least 3 out of 4 patients) and 27 contracting (in at least 2 out of 4 patients) clones were identified at the p < 0.05 level.\n Of 10 transcriptional states (clusters) identified in the IP CD8+ T-cell scRNA-seq data, we identified one significantly enriched in expanding clones (odds ratio (OR) 5.66; p<1e-15) and three enriched in contracting clones (OR range 2.41-25.71; p<1e-15). Neither the proportion of CAR+ cells (p = 0.52) nor the level of CAR expression (p = 0.48) differed among these states, suggesting that distinct cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs may influence cell fate.\n To elucidate these pathways, we compared the transcriptional profiles of expanding versus contracting clones. We observed that expanding clones exhibited higher expression of effector and differentiation markers including GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, and KLRG1; higher scores for “CD8+ cytotoxicity” (NES = 1.96, FDR = 0.0052), “NK-like activation” (NES = 1.77, FDR = 0.0053), and “effector memory” (Wilcoxon p = 7.35E-5); and lower “central memory” scores (Wilcoxon p < 2.2E-16) than contracting clones. Interestingly, analysis of the donor PBMCs used to generate the IP showed a similar phenotype among these clones, suggesting that this phenotype exists prior to manufacturing and is maintained throughout the manufacturing process.\n In conclusion, we found that identical CD8+ clones exhibiting an effector-like phenotype preferentially expanded in multiple recipients after allogeneic CD19 CAR T cell treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare clonal expansion patterns among recipients of a single lot of allogeneic CAR T cells. The striking similarity of expansion patterns across recipients demonstrates the importance of cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs in driving cell expansion after CAR T cell infusion. Moreover, our data highlight clones with effector-like molecular states as a key subset which could mediate antitumor responses to allogeneic CAR T cell products. These findings, as well as the presence of this phenotype in donor PBMCs prior to manufacturing, carry important implications for future development of these therapies.\n"

PCD has been recognized to be important in the regulation of normal and autoimmune responses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully known. To elucidate the role of the Fas Ag in lymphocyte activation, we investigated the influence of Fas Ag cross-linking on CD3/TCR-mediated signal transduction in IL-2-dependent human T cell lines. Early signal transduction events were evaluated in 10-day-old T cell lines using anti-Fas and anti-CD3 mAbs. Incubation of Indo-1-loaded cells with anti-Fas mAb (10 micrograms/ml), but not with an isotypic control mAb almost completely inhibited the anti-CD3-mediated Ca2+ influx. This inhibition was mAb concentration dependent and was detected after incubation for at least 15 min. Cross-linking of the Fas Ag did not affect the anti-CD3-mediated release of Ca2+ from the internal stores or the thapsigargin-mediated Ca2+ influx. Anti-Fas mAb-incubated cells also showed decreased CD3-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. Preincubation of cells with anti-Fas mAb inhibited the anti-CD3-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins. Cross-linking of the Fas Ag for up to 6 h did not alter the expression of CD3 on the surface of the T cells. Preincubation of Indo-1-loaded EBV-transformed B cells with anti-Fas mAb did not affect the anti-mu Ab-induced increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Our results show that cross-linking of the Fas Ag can suppress the receptor-mediated signaling process in human T but not B cells."

    "abstract" : "Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific field that promotes the standardized manufacturing of biological components without natural equivalents. Its goal is to create artificial living systems that can meet various needs in health care, nanotechnology and energy. Most works are currently focused on the individual bacterium as a chemical reactor. Our project, SynBioTIC, addresses a novel and more complex challenge: shape engineering, i.e. the redesign of natural morphogenesis toward a new kind of \" developmental 3D printing \". Potential applications include organ growth, natural computing in biocircuits, or future vegetal houses. Using realistic agent-based simulations of bacterial mats, we experiment with mechanisms allowing cell assemblies to collectively self-repair and develop complex structures. To create multicellular organisms that exhibit specific shapes (a completely original task) we construe their development iteratively by combining basic processes such as homeostasis, segmentation, and controlled proliferation in silico. We use the E. coli simulator Gro 1 , a physico-chemical computation platform offering reaction-diffusion and collision dynamics solvers. The synthetic \" bioware \" of our model executes a set of rules, or \" genome \" , in each cell. Cells can differentiate into several predefined types associated with specific actions (divide, tumble, emit signal, die, etc.). Transitions between types are triggered by conditions involving internal and external sensors that detect various protein levels inside and around the cell. There is no direct molecular signaling between two neighboring bacteria, only indirect communication via morphogen diffusion and the mechanical constraints of 2D packing. In any case, the overall architecture emerges in a purely endogenous fashion. For now, cell behaviors are set by rules hand-coded in the Gro script language. Starting from a single bacterium, our artificial creatures execute a series of developmental stages. First, isotropic proliferation produces a roughly circular population characterized by homeostatic activity (black and white cores in Fig. 1a,b). This is based on leader cells emitting a morphogen, while other cells continually divide and die at the periphery where the morphogen concentra-1 Jang, Oishi, Egbert & Klavins (2012) ACS Syn Biol, 1:365–74.

Each cell also contains an oscillatory mechanism acting like a internal clock. In the crown, these oscillators are synchronized, i.e. characterized by a uniform phase. At this stage, a new wave of morphogen is triggered by a randomly activated cell on the crown, and rapidly propagates (suppressing any competitor wave). The encounter between the wave front and the current state of the oscillator determines whether each cell differentiates, and into what type. The period of oscillations controls the number of segments that can appear. Finally, precursor cells emerge at the periphery of these segments and stimulate new local proliferation , which eventually triggers limb growth in a way similar to the apical meristem of plant shoots (Fig. 1c). Applying this mechanism to two segments and two precursors , North and South, then on the equator that they form (areas of equal morphogen concentration), the system gives rise to a second pair, East and West, i.e. four differentiated seeds in total. This makes it possible to control the growth and features of single appendages. The L and T shapes of Fig. 1 exemplify this \" divergence of homology \" : some precursors are inhibited while others create limbs of varying size. Such morphogenetic phenotypes allow us to envision more complex shapes made of an array of cores and limbs, by iterating the above processes. Most importantly, they open the door to an evolutionary (\" evo-devo \") exploration."

    "abstract" : "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis initially isolated in 1902 from a tuberculous cow (1). This isolate was cultured for 13 years until it lost its virulence and was developed into a vaccine by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerín in 1921 at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France. It is the only available vaccine to fight tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections as leprosy and Buruli ulcer disease (2,3). All the BCG substrains currently in use derive from the original strain produced, distributed to several countries. Currently, the main substrains are the Brazilian (Moreau/Rio de Janeiro), Danish (Copenhagen – 1331), Japanese (Tokyo – 172-1), Russian (Moscow – 368), and Bulgarian (Sofia – SL222). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended BCG vaccination since 1948 and recognized the Brazilian Moreau-RJ as a reference strain in 2012, along with the Russian, Danish, and Japanese strains (3, 4). During the 1970s, the Canadian urologist Alvaro Morales have studied BCG for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (5). Since then, intravesical BCG is still the most effective treatment, along with transurethral resection, to avoid NMIBC recurrence. According to all international guidelines, it is recommended as first-line therapy for NMIBC, as it reduces to almost half the recurrence rates (6-8). In addition to proven efficacy as a vaccine on genitourinary oncology, BCG is still the target for molecular and cellular research since the mechanisms activated by vaccination are complex, involving at least two responses: T cells antigen-specific and memory (classic adaptive immunity), and “trained” immunity (epigenetic reprogramming) mediated by innate immune cells (9, 10). This reprogramming occurs at the histone methylation level, inducing persistent conformational changes of chromatin in a mononuclear cell, exhibiting a long-lasting phenotype after vaccination with the ability to mediate specific and nonspecific protection against other infections, leading to a robust and faster immune response compared to adaptive immunity (9-12).

    "abstract" : "Background Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the major contributors to short-term graft function. Dissecting organ specific pathways and common molecular pathways associated with I/R injury among different organ types will help in better designing of specific therapeutic interventions. It will also help in understanding tissue specific injury and recovery mechanisms following early I/R injury. Methods 120 Gene expression (Affymetrix HG-U133Av2 Gene Chips) arrays were performed on allograft biopsies obtained from deceased donor kidney transplant recipients (n = 30) and liver transplant recipients (LTRs) (n = 30). From each patient, pre-implantation (PI) and post-reperfusion (PR) biopsies were obtained. Gene expression analysis was done using expression and transcriptome console softwares. PI and PR gene expression was compared in liver and kidney biopsies separately and probe sets were considered significant when the false discovery rate (FDR) was < 5 % and fold change greater than 1.5. IPA software and other gene enrichment and cell type enrichment softwares were used for further analysis of the data. Results Comparing gene expression in PI and PR biopsies from LTRs resulted in 438 probe sets and similar analysis in KTRs yielded 366 differentially expressed probe sets. Upon comparing the early I/R response in Liver and Kidney, it was observed that 40 – 50 % of the differentially expressed genes were similar in both organs and these genes were mainly involved in inflammatory pathways and transcription regulation. Around 28% of the common genes were transcription factors and around 12% were cytokines and growth factors. Among the top common pathways were IL6 signaling pathway, NF-KB signaling, HMGB1 signaling, and production of NO and ROS in macrophages. However, the main differences associated with liver specific I/R response genes involving growth factors and cytokines that relate to wound healing and additional reparative processes like angiogenesis. Also, additional molecular pathways involved in functions like T cell development, lymphopoiesis and response of neutrophils were exacerbated in the liver tissues. Otherwise, in kidney tissues undergoing I/R the initial unique molecular pathways were those involved in inhibition of growth of connective tissue Conclusion We identified common intra-allograft inflammatory responses to I/R injury between kidney and liver transplantation. However, liver grafts presented a faster activation of molecular profiles associated with regenerative, reparative and growth factors related functions."

Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell hyperactivity will lead to identification of specific therapeutic targets. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF)1 is an essential RNA-binding protein which controls posttranscriptional gene expression. We have demonstrated that SRSF1 levels are aberrantly decreased in T cells from SLE patients and correlate with severe disease, yet the role of SRSF1 in T cell physiology and autoimmune disease is largely unknown. Here we show that T cell-restricted Srsf1-deficient mice develop systemic autoimmunity and lupus-nephritis. Mice exhibit increased frequencies of activated/effector T cells producing proinflammatory cytokines, and an elevated T cell activation gene signature. Mechanistically, we noted increased activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and reduced expression of its repressor PTEN. The mTOR complex (mTORC)1 inhibitor rapamycin suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells and alleviated autoimmunity in Srsf1-deficient mice. Of direct clinical relevance, PTEN levels correlated with SRSF1 in T cells from SLE patients, and SRSF1 overexpression rescued PTEN, suppressed mTORC1 activation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Our studies reveal the role of a previously unrecognized molecule SRSF1 in restraining T cell activation and averting the development of autoimmune disease and a potential therapeutic target for lupus."

    "abstract" : "Background Th17 cells are central pathogenic mediators of autoimmune disease, including many forms of GN. IL-10 receptor signaling (IL-10R) in regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been implicated in the downregulation of Th17 cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of this process remain unclear.Methods We generated mice with Treg-specific IL-10Ra deficiency and subjected these mice to nephrotoxic serum-induced nephritis as a model of crescentic GN. Immune responses and Treg phenotypes were extensively analyzed.Results Compared with controls, mice with IL-10Ra-/- Tregs showed a spontaneously overshooting Th17 immune response. This hyper-Th17 phenotype was further boosted during GN and associated with aggravated renal injury. Notably, abrogation of IL-10Ra signaling in Tregs increased dendritic cell activation and production of Th17-inducing cytokines. In contrast, Treg trafficking and expression of chemokine receptor CCR6 remained unaffected, indicating mechanisms of Th17 control, differing from those of previously identified CCR6+ Treg17 cells. Indeed, the capacity for direct in vitro suppression of Th17 responses by IL-10Ra-/- Tregs was significantly impaired. As underlying pathology, analyses conducted in vitro and in vivo using double-fluorescent reporter mice revealed strikingly decreased IL-10 production by IL-10Ra-/- Tregs. To assess, whether reduced IL-10 could explain the hyper Th17 phenotype, competitive cotransfer experiments were performed. Supporting our concept, IL-10Ra-/- T cells differentiated into Th17 cells at much higher frequencies than wild type T cells did during GN.Conclusions IL-10R engagement optimizes Treg-mediated suppression of Th17 immunity. We hypothesize a feed-forward loop, in which IL-10Ra signaling reinforces IL-10 secretion by Tregs which potently controls Th17 development via direct and indirect mechanisms. IL-10R thus may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of GN."

Clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA into the tumor genome with persistent expression of viral T antigens causes at least 60% of all MCC.

    "abstract" : "Autoantibodies, once considered mere biomarkers of autoimmune disorders, are now recognized as central players in disease pathogenesis, offering critical insights into the breakdown of immune tolerance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the dual roles of autoantibodies—as diagnostic tools and direct mediators of tissue damage—across a spectrum of autoimmune diseases. We begin by exploring the mechanisms underlying autoantibody production, including genetic predispositions (e.g., HLA haplotypes), environmental triggers (infections, microbiome dysbiosis), and dysregulated B-cell/T-cell interactions. Pathogenic mechanisms are dissected, from complement activation and immune complex deposition to receptor blockade/activation (e.g., anti-TSH receptor in Graves’ disease) and molecular mimicry.\nHighlighting disease-specific autoantibodies, we detail their clinical implications in systemic lupus erythematosus (anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith), rheumatoid arthritis (anti-CCP), and neurological disorders (anti-NMDA receptor, anti-AQP4). The review underscores the diagnostic and prognostic utility of autoantibodies, while addressing challenges such as seronegative autoimmunity and assay variability. Current therapeutic strategies, including B-cell depletion (rituximab), complement inhibition (eculizumab), and cytokine modulation, are evaluated alongside emerging approaches like antigen-specific tolerance induction and CAR-T cell therapy.\nUnresolved questions—such as why some autoantibodies remain asymptomatic and their role in disease initiation—are discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research. Advances in single-cell technologies, proteomics, and AI-driven diagnostics promise to revolutionize personalized medicine, enabling early intervention and tailored therapies. By bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications, this review underscores the transformative potential of autoantibody research in redefining autoimmune disease management and moving toward curative strategies."

    "abstract" : "Chemical-induced oxidative stress to a cell can signal many cellular responses which include proliferation, differentiation, hemeostasis, apoptosis or necrosis. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms after exposure to chemicals, we investigated the signal transduction pathways, in particular the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the ICE/Ced-3 protease (caspase) pathway, activated by different agents. Butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) and its metabolite, t-butyl-hydroquinone (tBHQ), both are well known phenolic antioxidants used in food preservatives, strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and/or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with free radical scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH), or vitamin E, inhibited ERK2 activation and, to a much lesser extent, JNK 1 activation by BHA and tBHQ, implicating the role of oxidative stress. Under conditions where JNK1 and ERK2 were activated, BHA also activated transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B), activated-protein-1 (AP-1), and anti-oxidant response element (ARE), leading to induction of genes such as c-jun, and c-fos. At relatively high concentrations, BHA and tBHQ stimulated proteolytic activity of ICE/Ced3 cysteine proteases, and caused apoptosis, which was blocked by pretreatment with NAC. Further increase in concentrations lead to rapid cell death predominantly occurred via necrosis. Some naturally occurring phytochemicals, such as phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), green tea polyphenols (GTP), and sulfarophane, which have been shown to be potent inducers of Phase II enzymes, also differentially regulated the activities of JNK, ERK, or CPP-32, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our data, together with the work of others, enable us to propose a model in which low concentrations of these chemicals (e.g., BHA, PEITC) activate MAPKs leading to induction of gene expression (e.g., c-jun, c-fos, GSI) which may protect the cells against toxic insults and enhance cell survival. At relatively high concentrations, these agents activated both MAPKS, and the ICE/Ced-3 caspase pathway, leading to apoptosis. The exact mechanisms by which MAPK and caspases are activated by these agents are currently unknown, but may involve oxidative modification of glutathione (GSH) and/or protein thiols, and/or generation of secondary messengers, ceramide and calcium, which further activate downstream events. Taken together, our results suggest that chemicals including phenolic antioxidants activate MAPK pathways which may lead to the induction of genes producing protection and survival mechanisms, as well as the ICE/Ced-3 protease pathway, leading to apoptosis. The balancing amongst these pathways may dictate the fate of the cells upon exposure to chemicals."

    "abstract" : "T-cell mediated immune responses should be regulated to avoid the development of autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. Several mechanisms have been described to regulate this process, namely death of overactivated T cells by cytokine deprivation, suppression by T regulatory cells (Treg), induction of expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, or activation-induced cell death (AICD). In addition, activated T cells release membrane microvesicles called exosomes during these regulatory processes. In this review, we revise the role of exosome secretion in the different pathways of immune regulation described to date and its importance in the prevention or development of autoimmune disease. The expression of membrane-bound death ligands on the surface of exosomes during AICD or the more recently described transfer of miRNA or even DNA inside T-cell exosomes is a molecular mechanism that will be analyzed."
