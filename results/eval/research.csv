    "abstract" : "6021 Background: Currently, the landscape of treating advanced malignancies has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of immunotherapy employing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Notably, several ICIs have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities for individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC). An emerging body of evidence implies a plausible link between body mass index (BMI) and the effectiveness of ICIs in the broader context of cancer patients. Nevertheless, the specific correlation within the subset of head and neck cancer patients undergoing immunotherapeutic interventions remains unclear and warrants meticulous investigation. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched extensively for records published until January 2024. Full-text articles aligned with the research objective were included, while records published in English, case reports, reviews, editorials, and studies reporting immunotherapy combined with other cancer therapies were excluded. The data required for review and analysis was abstracted in Excel files by two independent reviewers. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software, and methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Only six studies were eligible for review and analysis. A subgroup analysis of data from these studies showed that obese HNC patients on immunotherapy had significantly better overall survival (OS) rates than non-obese patients (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 – 0.93; p=0.03). However, the progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically similar between obese and non-obese patients (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 – 1.33; p=0.30). In addition, when BMI was stratified as either low or high, no significant difference was observed in the OS and PFS of HNC patients (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.59 – 1.66; p=0.97 and HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61 – 1.41; p=0.42, respectively). Similarly, the statistical analyses showed that overweight patients have similar OS and PFS as patients with normal BMI (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.15 – 1.92; p=0.33 and HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.20 – 1.52; p = 0.25, respectively). In contrast, underweight patients demonstrated poor OS and PFS (HR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.29 – 5.12; p=0.008 and HR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.17 – 6.52; p=0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Obese HNC patients on immunotherapy tend to have improved OS than non-obese patients, while underweight patients have worse clinical prognoses than those with normal or above BMI."

    "abstract" : "Intorduction. HPV infection stimulates a local immune response, because HPV positivity in cervical cancer places these tumors in a prognostically better group in terms of response to radiotherapy (RT). However, the response to RT treatment in locally advanced cervical cancer depending on the presence of a certain subtype of the HPV virus has been very little investigated in previous research. Taking into account the high incidence rate of cervical cancer in developing countries, where the disease is most often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage, the aim of this review of the available literature was to analyse predictive potential of HPV typing in terms of the response to the RT with/without chemopotentiation as a standard treatment approach. Method. A review of studies dealing with the analysis of the predictive significance of HPV typing in locally advanced cervical cancer patients treated with definitive RT with or without chemopotentiation, from 2000 to 2024, was conducted. Results. Six clinical studies were identified that met the search criteria. The most frequently analyzed subtypes were HPV 16,18,33 and 52. In five studies the HPV 16 subtype was identified in more radioresistant cervical cancers. Conclusion: there is an exceptional clinical importance of HPV typing in order to create an individual treatment strategy, especially in the era of immunotherapy given concurrently with definitive RT. It is also necessary to conduct clinical studies with a large number of patients and consider what the treatment outcomes are depending on the applied RT technique, dose and fractionation regime."

    "abstract" : "\n 465\n \n \n Background:\n Gastric cancer (GC) is associated with significant mortality due to the limited efficacy of current conventional treatments, necessitating the need for novel therapies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore the potential role and outcomes of bi-specific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy in treating GC.\n Methods:\n Using PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrial.gov for 'Gastric cancers', 'bispecific antibodies', and 'CAR-T therapy' as of March 30, 2024. Out of 35 studies, 9 were selected for pooled analysis in R (v4.3.3) using the Der Simonian-Laird Estimator, calculating inter-study variance and extracting data with 95% CI.\n Results:\n 138 gastric cancer (GC) patients from 2 phase I (22.22%), 3 phase Ib (33.33%), 3 phase II (33.33%), and 1 case report (11.11%). Median age was 57 (28-77) years, and 76% (31/41) were male. Bispecific antibodies were MCLA-128 (25/138), catumaxomab (15/138), AK104 PD-1/CTLA-4 (16/138), ABL 001 DLL4VEGFA (19/138), and KN026 (25/138) while CART therapy was CT041 (38/138). The pooled overall response (OR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR) for bispecific antibodies was 37% (95% CI, 0.12-0.71, I2=76%, n=100, p <0.01), 21% (95% CI,0.05-0.55, I2=73%, n=85, p<0.01), and 11%(95% CI, 0.02-0.38, I2=63%, n=85, p=0.03) respectively, while the pooled OR, PR, and CR for CART was 56% (95% CI, 0.40-0.71, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.41), 53%(95% CI, 0.36-0.69, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.38, ), and 12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.42, I2=38%, n=38 p=0.2), respectively. The pooled disease control rate was 75% (95%CI,0.46-0.92, I2=79%, n=80, p < 0.01) for bispecific antibodies and 27% (95% CI,0.16-0.40, I2=0%, n=65, p=0.37) had the stable disease while pooled incidence of progressive disease was 18% (95% CI,0.09-0.31, I2=0%, n=55, p=0.53). The median progressive free survival was 6.74 months, with a median overall survival of 14.75 months. Common adverse effects included anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and cytokine release syndrome grades 1 or 2.\n Conclusions:\n This analysis shows promising results in GC patients using bi-specific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapy. However, further clinical trials are needed to fully explore their potential.\n"

    "abstract" : "Endometrial cancer (EC) is now the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, \"Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era.\" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC."

    "abstract" : "Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development."

This review highlights 10 landmark studies from 2024 that address emerging therapies and evolving clinical standards. Immunotherapy remains a central focus, with checkpoint inhibitors redefining the management of solid tumors and showing expanded applications across disease sites and earlier stages of disease. Targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab deruxtecan and enfortumab vedotin, are enhancing precision treatment options in metastatic cancer. Meanwhile, advances in supportive care, such as magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate cancer screening, ponsegromab for cachexia, and celiac plexus radiosurgery for pain, show enhanced symptom management and quality of life for patients. These innovations highlight the critical role of multidisciplinary approaches, where internal medicine physicians contribute to co-management and toxicity monitoring, ultimately optimizing patient care.

    "journal" : "Cancer Medicine",
    "abstract" : "ABSTRACT Background Melanoma is one of the most immunogenic malignancies, yet resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a major obstacle to durable therapeutic success. Emerging evidence indicates that aging‐related processes, including cellular senescence and immunosenescence, can reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) to favor immune evasion and disease progression. Senescent melanoma and stromal cells secrete a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that alters immune cell recruitment and function, while immunosenescence leads to diminished cytotoxic responses and the accumulation of dysfunctional or suppressive immune subsets. Aim This review explores the interplay between cellular senescence and immunosenescence in melanoma, highlighting their contributions to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance, and discusses potential strategies to therapeutically target senescence‐related pathways. Methods A systematic review of studies published between 2000 and 2024 was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Literature included mechanistic investigations of senescence in melanoma, analyses of immunosenescence in cancer patients, and preclinical or translational studies targeting senescence‐related pathways. Results and Conclusions Senescent tumor and stromal cells drive a pro‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive TME through SASP, while aging immune cells exhibit impaired antigen presentation, reduced cytotoxicity, and increased suppressive subsets. These dual processes form a self‐reinforcing cycle of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, ultimately undermining the efficacy of ICIs. Targeting senescence, through senolytics, senostatics, or SASP modulators, has shown promise in preclinical models and may restore immune competence in melanoma. However, clinical translation requires further investigation to validate safety and efficacy. Addressing both cellular and immune senescence represents a novel and promising direction to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve melanoma outcomes."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Immunotherapy (IO) has emerged as a promising treatment option shown to improve outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of its efficacy within the older patient population. In this systematic review, we examined randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the response to IO in older patients with TNBC. Methods: We searched Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Central (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The searches combined terms reflecting (1) the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab, durvalumab, and pembrolizumab; (2) breast cancer; and (3) RCTs. Results were limited to publications in English from 2013 to September 2023. Only articles that reported efficacy were included. Risk assessment was performed and overall risk of bias was graded. Two independent reviewers rated each study based on graded scales, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: Our systematic review identified 18 full-text papers on 11 unique RCTs. Only four RCTs presented results for patients 65 and older: KEYNOTE 355, KEYNOTE 522, IMPASSION 130, and IMPASSION 131. Of the first three RCTs, a total of 530 patients out of 2923 patients (18.1%) were 65 and older. The overall risk of bias was rated low or intermediate in all 11 RCTs. In the early-stage TNBC setting, 131 of 1174 patients (11.2%) were 65 and older in KEYNOTE 522. The reported primary endpoint pathological complete response (pCR) was significantly improved in patients in the overall intention to treat (ITT) population in the first interim analysis (IO arm n = 401 patients; control arm n = 201 patients) who received pembrolizumab versus placebo (estimated treatment difference 13.6%, 95% CI 5.4 – 21.8%, p<0.001). Of the 602 total patients, 71 patients (11.8%) were 65 and older (IO arm n = 46; control arm n = 25), the treatment difference was 22.3% (95% CI -2.1 – 43.5%, p=N/A). At the fourth interim analysis (IO arm = 784 patients; control arm = 390), the co-primary endpoint event-free survival (EFS) in ITT was 84.5% at 36 months follow up, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95% CI 0.48 – 0.82, p<0.001). In patients 65 and older, the HR was 0.79 but not statistically significant (95% CI 0.40 – 1.56, p=N/A). In IMPASSION 031, atezolizumab in the early-stage setting was shown to have a significant improvement in the primary endpoint pCR in the ITT population (IO arm n = 165; control arm n = 168; rate difference of 17%, 95% CI 6–27%, one-sided p=0.0044). In the metastatic setting, KEYNOTE 355 showed that for a total of 323 patients with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 10, median OS was 23.0 months in the IO arm compared to 16.1 months in the control arm (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 – 0.95; p=0.0185) at median 44.1 months follow-up. In patients 65 and older with CPS ≥10 (n = 66), median OS was 28.3 months in the IO arm (n= 42) and 12.6 months in the control arm (n= 24) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 – 0.92, p=N/A). In the metastatic setting, atezolizumab has not been shown to significantly improve OS in the ITT overall population or age-specific groups <65 or ≥65 in the final analysis of IMPASSION130. Conclusion: There is a significant gap in data from RCTs evaluating the efficacy of IO in older patients with TNBC. The only FDA-approved IO in TNBC, pembrolizumab, was shown in the early-stage setting to improve pCR and EFS in older patients but was not statistically significant. In the metastatic setting, pembrolizumab significantly improved OS in older patients with CPS ≥10. Both studies had a limited number of patients 65 and older. No other studies reported statistically significant outcomes in patients ≥65. These results underscore the need for further research in older patients.\n Citation Format: Marie Liu, Carrie Sha, Diana Lake, Jasmeet Singh, Mark Robson, W. Iris Zhi.

    "abstract" : "TPS2700 Background: Though immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, when used as monotherapy in the advanced setting, only 18-25% of patients respond to ICI. Notably, ICI frequently lacks anti-tumor activity in immune-cold cancers where T cell priming is missing. Recent breakthroughs in identifying personal neoantigens via a comprehensive analysis of cancer sequencing data have brought increased attention to neoantigen cancer vaccines. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have shown early promise. While neoantigens have recently been investigated in some cancer types, the current neoantigen prediction algorithms have often focused on the MHC class-I subtype, single nucleotide mutations (SNM), small insertions and deletions (INDEL). We recently developed an informatics workflow, REAL-neo, for the identification, quality control (QC), and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound neoantigens that arise from somatic SNM, INDEL, aberrant RNA splicing, and gene fusions, generating much more potent neoantigen candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrated robust T-cell response and prolonged survival by combining ICI and cancer vaccines in preclinical models. This single-arm phase I clinical trial is in progress to assess the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of personalized neoantigen vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid cancers. Methods: The vaccine consists of up to 20 peptides (15-30 mer) comprising patient-specific neoantigens identified from tumor DNA and mRNA sequencing data using REAL-neo and delivered with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. The first cohort of three patients will be treated at dose level 1 consisting of 4 or 5 peptides at 300 mcg/peptide and GM-CSF 125 mcg per injection site in each of four limbs. After Cohort 1 is deemed safe, the study will expand to cohort 2, when patients will be enrolled at the same dose level for vaccine plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. Neoantigen vaccine will be given via subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 21 (cohorts 1 and 2) and weeks 5 and 8 (booster dose for cohort 2 only). Cohort 1 has been completed without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Enrollment in Cohort 2 began in January 2024. AEs are assessed according to CTCAE v5. and safety findings are reviewed by data safety medical board (DSMB). Key eligibility criteria include 1) histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies and 2) cancer progression after at least one line of the standard-of-care (SOC) systemic treatment. For cohort 2, patients must be eligible to receive pembrolizumab per SOC or the treating physician’s judgment. Clinical trial information: NCT05269381 ."

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–90% of all lung cancers. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an expanding targeted therapy option for the treatment of NSCLC. The aim is to perform a systematic literature review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of ADCs currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, ClinicalTrial.gov and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Only randomized and non-randomized phase II-IV clinical trials focusing on ADC-based therapies for adult patients affected by NSCLC were selected. The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) were used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in the included randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively. While GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Efficacy endpoints were categorized based on primary outcomes while safety was assessed through the frequency and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), and a qualitative summary of the findings was conducted. Results: A total of seven studies, including three randomized, three non-randomized, and one without specific allocation, were included, comprising 1287 patients, with 693 (54%) men, and an average age of 63 years old. Two studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias, while six had a moderate risk or some concerns. Five ADCs were evaluated: trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), telisotuzumab vedotin, patritumab deruxtecan, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). T-DXd demonstrated superior efficacy in HER2-overexpressing and HER2-mutant NSCLC, with an ORR of 52.9% and 49.0%, respectively. However, HER2-mutant patients exhibited a longer median DOR (16.8 vs. 6.2 months) but a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (38.6% vs. 22%). T-DM1 showed modest efficacy, with an ORR of 20% in HER2-overexpressing NSCLC and 6.7% in HER2-mutant patients. Dato-DXd demonstrated improved ORR (26.4% vs. 12.8%) and PFS (4.4 vs. 3.7 months) compared to docetaxel. Patritumab deruxtecan achieved an ORR of 39% in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while telisotuzumab vedotin exhibited limited activity in c-MET-positive NSCLC (ORR 9%, median DOR 7.5 months). Frequency and severity of TEAEs varied across ADCs, with ILD being a major concern, highlighting the need for strict patient monitoring and early intervention to mitigate severe adverse events. Conclusions: ADCs represent a promising advancement in NSCLC treatment, offering targeted therapeutic options beyond conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. T-DXd has emerged as the most effective ADC for HER2-mutant NSCLC with manageable safety profile, whereas Dato-DXd provides a viable alternative for TROP2-expressing tumors. While ADCs offer significant clinical benefits, careful patient selection and proactive management of adverse events remain crucial. Ongoing and future trials will further refine the role of ADCs in personalized NSCLC treatment, potentially expanding their tumor-agnostic use to broader patient populations."

    "abstract" : "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and metabolically distinct subtype of breast cancer characterized by immune evasion, a high reliance on glycolysis, and poor treatment outcomes. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, there is an urgent need for novel, targeted approaches that integrate immune stimulation with metabolic disruption. This review explores the potential of intratumoral Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) therapy as a dual-action strategy in TNBC, focusing on its ability to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors when simultaneously targeting TNBC’s metabolic vulnerabilities. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying 60 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The selection criteria focused on BCG’s role in oncology, its immunological and metabolic effects, and its application in solid tumors. Studies were assessed for methodological rigor using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles checklist. BCG enhances antitumor immunity by engaging Toll-like receptors, triggering proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-12), and promoting the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. This immune activation reprograms the tumor microenvironment, increasing susceptibility to immunotherapy. Simultaneously, BCG disrupts TNBC’s glycolytic dependence by downregulating hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, forcing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, BCG-induced “trained immunity” epigenetically reprograms innate immune cells, enhancing long-term tumor surveillance and reducing recurrence risk. Intratumoral BCG presents a promising immunometabolic intervention for TNBC by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and disrupting tumor metabolism. Future studies should focus on optimizing its clinical application, developing sustained-release formulations, and exploring synergistic combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and metabolic inhibitors. By addressing TNBC’s dual vulnerabilities, this strategy may redefine treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract" : "Abstract Whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or perioperative chemotherapy is superior for localized esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers has been a topic of long-standing debate. For years, standard of care in the United States for localized esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been physician’s choice between the 2 strategies. More recently, adjuvant immunotherapy has also been introduced into the treatment approach for those who received neoadjuvant CRT. While preoperative radiation remains an important option for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, the ESOPEC trial presented in 2024 suggested that perioperative chemotherapy is superior to preoperative CRT in EAC. In addition, the results of the TOPGEAR trial presented in 2024 showed that adding CRT to perioperative chemotherapy did not lead to improved outcomes. This has led to a shift in practice among oncologists. However, there are various complexities and factors to consider when interpreting these studies. In this review, we outline both trials and what their findings may mean for the future of preoperative CRT in EAC. Ultimately, until more data are available that incorporate novel agents such as immunotherapy, these studies indicate that we should defer the routine inclusion of radiation in preoperative treatment for EAC."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Pembrolizumab is a novel immunotherapy agent that improves oncological outcomes in various cancer types. Although there are minor immune-related adverse events (irAEs) when used alone, various irAEs have been reported when it is combined with chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to investigate irAEs that occurred after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with pembrolizumab based on the KEYNOTE-522 regimen for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to identify fatal irAEs that should be corrected before surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Between 2022 and 2024, a total of, 71 cases from 81 patients who completed NAC with pembrolizumab based on KEYNOTE-522 regimen (wP/Cab and pembrolizumab followed by AC and pembrolizumab) followed by surgery were reviewed based on their medical records. All irAEs that occurred were investigated and classified into five categories: systemic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and endocrine. Underlying diseases that existed before the diagnosis of breast cancer or complications that occurred after surgery were excluded. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.62 (SD, ±10.6) years, and the stages at diagnosis were as follows: IIA (n=23, 32.4%), IIB (n=22, 31.0%), IIIA (n=14, 16.2%), IIIB (n=1, 1.4%), and IIIC (n=11, 15.5%). After NAC with pembrolizumab, the pCR rate was 49.3% (35/71) Fifty-three patients (62.2%) experienced adverse events, and the number of adverse events were as follows: 1 (n=11, 20.8%), 2 (n=20, 37.7%), and ≥3 (n=22, 41.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common (n=46, 86.8%), and dermatologic symptoms were the second most common (n=31, 58.5%). Among fatal irAEs, including colitis and pneumonitis, they occurred in 11 patients (20.8%) and 2 patients (3.8%), respectively. There was no case of hepatitis, myocarditis, or hypophysitis as fatal irAEs after NAC and pembrolizumab for TNBC. Among these irAEs, thyroid disorders (n=16, 22.5%) were the most common adverse event after skin rash and nausea. Of the patients with thyroid disorders, 3 experienced fatal dysfunction. Their surgeries were delayed for an average of 8.5 weeks to correct the thyroid imbalance before they could safely undergo general anesthesia. The remaining patients, who did not experience such complications, were able to undergo surgery after an average of 5.2 weeks. Conclusion: The irAEs that occurred after NAC with pembrolizumab in TNBC were varied and included some that were severe enough to affect the timing of surgery under general anesthesia. Thyroid dysfunction, in particular, should be evaluated and corrected during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy to prevent delays in surgery.\n Citation Format: Byeongju Kang, Jung Eun Choi, Moohyun Lee, Ho Yong Park, Jin Hyang Jung, Soo Jung Lee, Su Hwan Kang, Jin Gu Kang, Sun Hee Kang, Jihyoung Cho, Yee Soo Chae, Soo Jung Lee, In-Hee Lee, Keon Uk Park, Hyera Kim, Jeeyeon Lee.

    "abstract" : "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Currently, programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have become the first choice for breast cancer immunotherapies. Despite paclitaxel being considered a cornerstone drug in breast cancer treatment, the effectiveness, safety, and optimal drug selection for its combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors remain uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, performing a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database through May 18, 2024. Selected trials were those that assessed the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for the treatment of TNBC. The primary endpoint assessed was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), overall response rate (ORR), and Pathological complete response (pCR). This study is registered in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023429651. Results: A total of 8 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria were included, involving 4626 patients who received either Paclitaxel (Paclitaxel-placebo/chemotherapy) or a combination of durvalumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, toripalimab with paclitaxel. The pooled results demonstrated that Durvalumab combined with Paclitaxel significantly reduced the hazard ratio for OS (surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA]: 91.05%) and PFS compared with Paclitaxel alone (SUCRA: 83.52%). Additionally, Durvalumab plus Paclitaxel significantly improved the ORR compared with Paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10–5.20). For safety outcomes, Atezolizumab plus Paclitaxel showed a favorable profile in AEs, with no significant differences observed between groups. In the pCR study, Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel was the most effective treatment option (SUCRA: 81.85%). Conclusions: When combined with paclitaxel, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibit a favorable survival benefit. The combination of Durvalumab and paclitaxel represents the optimal treatment option. In the future, attention should be paid to the TNBC subtypes and drug dosage, as these factors may help to design personalized TNBC treatment programs."

    "abstract" : "RATIONALE\nPreserving health-related quality of life is an aspect of care that requires constant attention from the time of cancer diagnosis. Melatonin has been used to diminish treatment-related side effects and cancer symptoms, and as a medication to regulate circadian rhythm. An up-to-date systematic review is needed to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nTo identify studies for inclusion in this review, we used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and four trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 10 September 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer of any stage that evaluated melatonin (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment) versus no treatment or placebo (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment), or standard anticancer treatment. Standard anticancer treatment refers to treatments to stop or prevent cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and sleep quality within three months, and melatonin-related adverse events. Other outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, tumour response, and anticancer treatment-related harms.\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies included in the review.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If this was not possible, due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results in a narrative format. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe identified 30 RCTs (reported in 49 publications) involving 5093 adult participants with cancer (2470 males, 2228 females, 395 not reported). Studies were conducted in a hospital setting and took place in at least 10 countries. We assessed two studies at low risk of bias and the other 28 at high risk of bias.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nMelatonin plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life score (MD 2.60, 95% CI -14.53 to 19.73; 1 study, 126 participants; very low certainty evidence), and sleep score (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.42; 1 study, 50 participants; very low certainty evidence) within three months. We are also very uncertain about potential adverse effects of melatonin: headache (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 23.14; 1 study, 25 participants; very low certainty evidence); fatigue (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 2 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty evidence); and nausea (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.56; 1 study, 146 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of high risk of bias, small sample size, the width of the 95% confidence interval, and indirectness due to inadequate reporting of cancer type. Melatonin plus standard treatment versus standard treatment No data are available relating to quality of life and sleep within three months. The evidence is very uncertain about headaches (experienced by 15 of 820 participants in melatonin groups, with no data available for control groups; 2 studies, 1640 participants; very low certainty evidence). Melatonin likely reduces the incidence of fatigue (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.55; 10 studies, 1359 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00; 6 studies, 710 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Melatonin (topical use) plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life (one study reported no difference between groups, both having the same median score of 66.7; 48 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to sleep and adverse events (including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias, small sample size, and insufficient data.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe available evidence is of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving treatment for cancer. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Data were lacking for some outcomes, such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. Since the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited due to insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, the decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment cannot easily be made at the current time.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by AG Biologische Krebstherapie, Deutsche Krebshilfe (grant numbers 70-301 and 109863).

    "abstract" : "Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very common type of head and neck cancer, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 50%. Inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway have gained widespread clinical adoption. However, the relationship between the infiltration characteristics of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effect of immunotherapy on HNSCC remains to be explored. Methods Patients diagnosed with HNSCC who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy were reviewed between February 2021 and March 30, 2024, in our single center. The laryngoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathologic response were evaluated to the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Result Our analysis involved 42 patients who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients underwent surgical treatment following the completion of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Among them, 6 patients achieved pCR (33%). The 1-year OS rate of the 42 patients enrolled in the study was 95.05%, and the 1-year PFS rate was 89.86%. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphocyte density in HNSCC prior to the administration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy efficacy. Compared with pretreatment, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly decreased, and the lymphocyte density was significantly increased in HNSCC patients after immunotherapy. Conclusions The integration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective strategy, can improve the tumor response rate and survival rate, and is a valuable treatment for patients with HNSCC. Furthermore, the study suggests that an elevated NLR within the HNSCC tumor microenvironment could potentially serve as a biomarker indicative of diminished immunotherapy efficacy.

    "abstract" : "\n e20593\n \n \n Background:\n Tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is emerging as a promising immunotherapy agent and has demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability in recent lung cancer trials. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of Tislelizumab, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy (Group 1), as a superior treatment alternative for lung cancer compared to standard chemotherapy (Group 2) in improving patient outcomes.\n Methods:\n Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to December 2024 to identify Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Hazards ratio (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) were generated, by employing a Random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Our outcomes of interest were Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of response (DOR), and treatment-related adverse Events.\n Results:\n A total of 6 RCTs involving 2107 patients were included for analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that Group 1 significantly improved PFS, OS, and DOR with HRs of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.71-1.99; p <0.00001, I² = 0%), 2.01 (95% CI: 1.75-2.29; p <0.00001, I² = 0%) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.52-3.03; p <0.0001, I² = 39%), respectively. Group 1 has better DCR and ORR compared to Group 2 with RRs of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12-2.07; p= 0.007, I² = 97%) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.20-1.86; p= 0.0003, I² = 83%), respectively. The high heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis of DCR (I² = 97%) and ORR (I² = 83%) likely reflects variability in study populations, treatment protocols, and response assessment criteria across the included RCTs. Subgroup or sensitivity analyses could help identify contributing factors. Despite the heterogeneity, the pooled effect sizes indicate a statistically significant improvement in DCR and ORR with Tislelizumab, with caution warranted when generalizing these findings. Group 1 significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared to Group 2 (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.95; p = 0.0003), with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%). No significant differences were found in adverse events, except for ALT elevations. (RR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14–1.61; p = 0.0006, I² = 25%).\n Conclusions:\n Tislelizumab, with or without chemotherapy, demonstrates greater PFS and OS benefits compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with lung cancer. There was a significantly reduced all-cause mortality in the intervention group; however, the observed increase in the risk of ALT elevation underscores the need for vigilant liver function monitoring. When combined with chemotherapy, Tislelizumab presents a promising treatment option for lung cancer.\n"

Here we report the results of primary analysis. Methods: WU-KONG1 Part B is a phase 2, multinational pivotal study to assess the antitumor efficacy of sunvozertinib at two dose levels, 200 mg and 300 mg, in platinum pre-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon20ins. Eligible patients were randomized at the ratio of 1:1 to receive 200 mg or 300 mg sunvozertinib once daily until discontinuation criteria were met. Randomization was stratified by brain metastasis at baseline and number of regimens of prior systemic anti-cancer therapy. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) (per RECIST v1.1) and key secondary endpoint included IRC assessed duration of response (DoR). Results: As of January 4, 2024, a total of 184 patients were randomized to receive sunvozertinib treatment at 200 mg or 300 mg. Patients who met the predefined criteria for efficacy analysis were included in the primary analysis. The majority of patients (96.0%) had metastatic diseases, 60.7% had ECOG PS of 1, and 23.7% had baseline brain metastasis. All patients received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and 43.4% and 13.3% had prior onco-immunotherapy or amivantamab treatment. Per IRC assessment, the best ORR was 54.3% (41.0% confirmed and 5.8% pending confirmation). Confirmed complete response (CR) was achieved in 2.9% patients. The disease control rate (including CR, PR and stable disease) was 90.8%. The primary endpoint met its predefined target, with statistical significance. Tumor response was observed in patients with baseline brain metastasis, different demographics and EGFR exon20ins subtypes. With median follow-up time of 5.5 months for responders, the duration of response has not been reached, with 74.6% responders still responding. The PFS data are not mature with approximately 6-month follow-up. Safety findings were similar to previously reported results of sunvozertinib in other clinical studies. The most common drug-related TEAEs included diarrhea, skin rash and CPK increase. The majority of the TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and clinically manageable. Conclusions: In this primary analysis of WU-KONG1 multinational pivotal study, sunvozertinib demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in platinum pre-treated NSCLC with EGFR exon20ins, with a tolerable safety profile. The updated data will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT03974022 ."

The development of increasingly potent cancer treatments has helped to improve cancer survival, but at the potential cost of cardiovascular toxicity. These cardiovascular complications can occur during or after cancer treatment, in short, medium or long term. This study aims to provide an overview of the clinical activity of the first nurse-led cardio-oncology clinic in the United Kingdom.\n \n \n \n This is a single centre, retrospective, observational cohort study reviewing our cardio-oncology clinic activity from 2023 to 2024. Patients receiving cancer treatment were included if they were referred to the nurse-led clinic for treatment and management of their cardiovascular condition before, during or after treatment.\n \n \n \n 534 patients were seen in the nurse-led Cardio-Oncology clinic, 102 of these patients were new referrals who were then followed up throughout the year from 2023-2024. The mean age of the patients was 65+14 years old and 46 (45%) were male. Amongst the new referrals, haematological and breast malignancies were most common (27.4% and 30.3% respectively), followed by lung and sarcoma malignancies (both 7.8%). Eighteen (17.6%) were treated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies, 23.5% of patient received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Seven (6.8%) received immunotherapy, 10 (9.8%) received radiotherapy, 8 patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 (2.9%) received taxane, 5 (5.8%) were treated with 5FU and 1 (0.9%) CDKi inhibitor. Six (5.8%) patients had surgery and two (1.9%) underwent stem cell transplants. Six (5.8%) patients had combination therapy and 8 (7.8%) had other disease-specific treatments.\n Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) was most common cardiovascular complication in 33 (32.3%) of patients referred, then 14 cases of (13.7%) HF with preserved EF, arrhythmia in 12 (11.7%), 10 (9.8%) presented with chest pain, 15 (14.7%) treated for hypertension and 9 (8.8%) referred prior to chemotherapy.\n More than half of the HF referrals (30.3%) resulted from cancer treatment-related heart dysfunction.\n Sixty-two (60.7%) patients referred were only having nurse-led follow-up in the Cardio-Oncology clinic and were no longer being seen in the doctor’s clinic. Forty-two (41.1%) continued cardiotoxic cancer treatment with monitoring in nurse-led clinic and 12 (11.7%) patients died due to cancer disease progression.\n \n \n \n The Cardio-Oncology nurse-led clinic encompasses holistic patient care and permits rapid up-titration of medications to optimal target dosages, resulting in treatment of cardiovascular conditions thus significant improvements in cardiac function, education, and support of side effect management. This allows uninterrupted continuation of cancer treatment, with the potential to translate into better long-term cancer and cardiovascular outcomes.  Figure 1table continued\n"

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (mTLS) predict improved outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, a significant proportion of patients with TLS-positive tumors do not respond to ICI when used as a single agent and may therefore benefit from combination therapy. The multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, deplete regulatory T cells, an immune population associated with resistance to ICI in TLS-positive tumors. We report the results of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab combined with regorafenib in patients with mTLS-positive advanced solid tumors.\n Methods: ‘Regomune’ is an open-label, multicenter phase II study assessing the combination of avelumab (10mg/kg IV every 14 days) with regorafenib (160 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle) in patients with advanced mTLS-positive solid tumors. The mTLS status was centrally assessed as previously described (Vanhersecke et al Nature Cancer 2021). All patients had confirmed progressive disease at inclusion, based on a central review of imaging. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 6-month non-progression rate using RECIST v1.1 based on blinded central review. 29 assessable patients were deemed necessary, and to meet the primary endpoint, at least 8 patients needed to be progression-free at 6 months.\n Results: Between January 2021 and July 2022, 132 patients (5 centers) underwent mTLS screening. Of these, 55 (41.7%) were identified as mTLS+, and 38 were included in the study. The top five histological subtypes were MSS colorectal cancer (15.8%), sarcoma (13.1%), oesogastric (10.5%), biliary tract (7.9%), and pancreatic cancer (7.9%). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (23.7%), maculo-papular rash (18.4%), fatigue, and oral mucositis (7.9% each). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Of the 34 patients assessed for efficacy, 16 (47%) showed tumor shrinkage, with 9 achieving a partial response (26.7%) and 7 having stable disease (20.6%). The median duration of response was 6 months. Twelve patients (comprising various tumor types including MSS colorectal cancer, small bowel carcinomas, biliary tract cancer, sarcomas, thyroid and gynecological tumors.) were progression-free at 6 months, marking the study’s primary endpoint achievement. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.6 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of tumor tissues, and comprehensive plasma proteomics analysis have collectively uncovered critical biomarkers that significantly determine both sensitivity and resistance to treatment.\n Conclusions: This is the first histology-agnostic clinical trial employing mTLS as a biomarker for patient selection for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen. Durable responses were recorded, even in cases typically resistant to immunotherapy, confirming the predictive value of mTLS.\n Trial Registration NCT03475953\n Citation Format: Antoine Italiano, Sophie Cousin, Carine Bellera, Jean-Philippe Guegan, Jean-Philippe Metges, Antoine Adenis, Rastilav Bahleda, Philippe Cassier, Coralie Cantarel, Michele Kind, Jean Palussiere, Lucile Vanhersecke, Alban Bessede.

Долгое время адъювантная химиотерапия оставалась единственной лекарственной опцией адъювантного лечения пациентов с немелкоклеточным раком лёгкого (НМРЛ) IB–IIIA стадий. Необходимость открытия новых подходов в адъювантном лечении НМРЛ, безусловно, связана с невысокими результатами общей выживаемости и с высоким риском рецидива рака лёгкого после проведения исключительно химиотерапии.

For a long time, adjuvant chemotherapy remained the only drug option for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IB–IIIA. The necessity to discover new approaches to the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC is certainly associated with low overall survival results and a high risk of lung cancer relapse after chemotherapy alone. In the course of the evolution of knowledge about tumor biology, molecular mechanisms of cancer development and spread, two new areas of adjuvant therapy have emerged - targeted and immunotherapy. This review discusses phase III studies, the results of which demonstrated improved survival rates in patients who received innovative adjuvant therapy, which made it possible to introduce new options for adjuvant therapy for NSCLC into clinical practice. The timeframes for the implementation of these options in practical recommendations are also reflected."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with global impact, especially in the context of the rising epidemic of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape for HCC is evolving and has changed significantly in the last few years with new treatment options for patients, while the multidisciplinary team model of care remains critical. This review aims to summarize the various treatment options for patients at all stages of HCC, highlighting the growing array of systemic therapies with multi-modal options, including the potential of combining locoregional therapies with immunotherapy across different stages of the disease. With the increasing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, the future paradigm of HCC care includes the incorporation of non-hospice palliative care in the multidisciplinary team care model to improve patient quality of care, quality of life, and overall outcomes. Abstract Liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes up the majority of liver cancer cases. Despite the stabilization of incidence rates in recent years due to effective viral hepatitis treatments, as well as improved outcomes from early detection and treatment advances, the burden of HCC is anticipated to rise again due to increasing rates of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape is evolving and requires a multidisciplinary approach, often involving multi-modal treatments that include surgical resection, transplantation, local regional therapies, and systemic treatments. The optimal approach to the care of the HCC patient requires a multidisciplinary team involving hepatology, medical oncology, diagnostic and interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and surgery. In order to determine which approach is best, an individualized treatment plan should consider the patient’s liver function, functional status, comorbidities, cancer stage, and preferences. In this review, we provide an overview of the current treatment options and key trials that have revolutionized the management of HCC. We also discuss evolving treatment paradigms for the future."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, requiring new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This research arises from the need to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The authors aim to systematically evaluate the potential of emerging biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNAs and mutational load of blood tumors and their relationship with different treatments. The findings of this study could have a significant impact on the research community by providing a basis for integrating these biomarkers into clinical practice, thereby improving personalized treatment strategies and patient outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. Abstract Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, often diagnosed at advanced stages, which diminishes the effective treatment options and survival rates. This systematic review assesses the utility of emerging biomarkers—circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB)—enhanced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the diagnostic accuracy, prognostic evaluation, and treatment strategies in NSCLC. Analyzing data from 37 studies involving 10,332 patients from 2020 to 2024, the review highlights how biomarkers like ctDNA and PD-L1 expression critically inform the selection of personalized therapies, particularly beneficial in the advanced stages of NSCLC. These biomarkers are critical for prognostic assessments and in dynamically adapting treatment plans, where high PD-L1 expression and specific genetic mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, EGFR mutations) significantly guide the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The findings recommend integrating these biomarkers into standardized clinical pathways to maximize their potential in enhancing the treatment precision, ultimately fostering significant advancements in oncology and improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review substantiates the prognostic and predictive value of these biomarkers and emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation in biomarker research."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: The treatment algorithm following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) remains uncertain. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and the first network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs (or combined new drugs) for the treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive/HER2-Negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with CDK4/6i. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched from 2000 to 2024 and conference proceedings from major congresses of the last two years were retrieved. Two authors independently performed the screening, three authors extracted data, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) as secondary endpoints. The new drugs (or combined new drugs) were compared to either standard chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy alone (ET) in second-line and beyond treatment settings. Network meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, calculating risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and chi-square test. Results: A total of 4034 papers were identified, after removing duplicates. Out of the 67 studies screened in full-text, 26 clinical trials were selected, encompassing a total of 7083 patients and five different drug classes. Specifically, 9 studies included biological agnostic therapy (CDK4/6i, mTOR inhibitors, immunotherapy), 7 novel ET (including selective estrogen receptor degraders – oral SERD), 5 targeted therapies (PI3K, AKT and PARP inhibitors), 3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs: trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd] and sacituzumab govitecan), and 2 CT (eribulin, VEX metronomic). Control arms consisted of either ET alone (mainly fulvestrant) or standard CT (paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All network estimates coincided with pairwise estimates as no direct comparison between the new drugs existed in the literature. Among all therapies, T-DXd showed the largest PFS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.51 (CI: 0.45 – 0.57)], followed by ribociclib plus ET compared to ET alone [HR 0.57 (CI: 0.45 – 0.72)]. Interaction tests conducted among the five drug classes showed a significant different positive effect on PFS by targeted therapies [HR 0.61 (CI: 0.57 – 0.66)] compared to ET alone (p-value 0.009) but failed to identify significant differences in PFS among the different drug classes compared to CT (p-value 0.16), although ADCs showed a larger effect in PFS [HR 0.63 (CI: 0.50 – 0.80)]. Although ADCs showed the largest OS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.72 (CI: 0.58 – 0.89)], the interaction test among the drug classes was not significant (p-value 0.10), and similarly no interaction was observed for ORR. Conversely, the interaction test for toxicity indicates a significant difference between the five drug classes compared to ET, with biological agnostic therapy showing greater toxicity [HR 4.81 (CI: 3.18 – 7.25)] compared to other treatment options. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis showed that targeted therapies, such as PI3K, AKT, and PARP inhibitors, demonstrate significant improvement in PFS compared to ET with a positive interaction test among the different drug classes. Biological agnostic therapies offer some survival improvement but at the cost of increased toxicity as compared to other options. These findings could help tailor the most suitable treatment for each patient, determining the optimal sequence following progression to CDK4/6i for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC.\n Citation Format: Mariangela Gaudio, Michela Cinquini, Flavia Jacobs, Cristina Mazzi, Valter Torri, Antonino Carmelo Tralongo, Chiara Benvenuti, Riccardo Gerosa, Jacopo Canzian, Giuseppe Saltalamacchia, Rita de Sanctis, Armando Santoro, Alberto Zambelli.

    "abstract" : "\n Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 amplification. This unique molecular profile limits treatment options, as TNBC does not respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies, making chemotherapy the cornerstone of systemic treatment. Achieving a complete pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved long-term outcomes and survival rates in TNBC patients. However, pCR rates can vary significantly depending on the chemotherapy regimen used, as well as the inclusion of other modalities such as immunotherapy. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted at Chihuahua's State Cancer Center, where medical records of patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with TNBC between January 2012 and June 2023 were reviewed to evaluate pCR after neoadjuvant treatment. The study compared the effectiveness of three chemotherapy regimens: anthracyclines and taxanes (AC-T), anthracyclines combined with taxanes and carboplatin (AC-Tcarboplatin), and any chemotherapy regimen paired with immunotherapy (IT). Fisher's exact tests were used to compare pCR rates across these groups, with p-values calculated to determine clinical significance and identify the most effective treatment strategies. In total, 1279 breast cancer patients were included, with 182 (14.23%) diagnosed with TNBC. Among these, 92 (50.55%) received neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in 35 (19.23%) achieving pCR. Upon observing the pCR rates among different regimens, we found clinical relevance in the variations. Statistically significant differences were confirmed when comparing neoadjuvant treatments in relation to pCR rates (p=0.029). Sixty patients received the AC-T regimen, achieving a pCR rate of 26.67%. Thirteen patients received AC-Tcarboplatin, with a pCR rate of 46.15%. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, showing a high pCR rate of 92.31%. Finally, 6 patients received other chemotherapy regimens without immunotherapy or carboplatin, with only 1 (16.67%) achieving pCR.This analysis highlights significant differences in pCR rates depending on the administered treatment, emphasizing firstly the clear benefits of adding carboplatin to the neoadjuvant regimen. Additionally, although the number of patients treated with immunotherapy was limited, the results unequivocally indicate its benefit in significantly enhancing complete pathological responses compared to other treatment groups. While each therapeutic group demonstrated specific advantages in pCR rates, stressing the critical importance of early access to advanced therapeutic options such as immunotherapy from the time of TNBC diagnosis is crucial. Finally, it is recommended to establish better public policies to improve access to these treatments and explore the potential additional benefits of low-dose immunotherapy in future research to further optimize clinical outcomes.\n Citation Format: Enrique José Zamudio Lozoya, Luisa Fernanda González-González, Victor Baylon-Valdez, Paolo Mendoza-Muraira, Regina Martínez-García-Lascurain, Patricio Ochoa Elizondo, Rafael Martínez-Sanciprián, Beatriz De León-Jiménez, Alma Andrea Elizaldi-San Miguel, Gustavo Gil Reza Bravo, América Susana Mares García, René Lázaro González-Mendoza.

    "abstract" : "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are iron-dependent and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). All three epigenetic modifications are intermediates in DNA demethylation. TET proteins are recruited by transcription factors and by RNA polymerase II to modify 5mC at enhancers and gene bodies, thereby regulating gene expression during development, cell lineage specification, and cell activation. It is not yet clear, however, how the established biochemical activities of TET enzymes in oxidizing 5mC and mediating DNA demethylation relate to the known association of TET deficiency with inflammation, clonal hematopoiesis, and cancer. There are hints that the ability of TET deficiency to promote cell proliferation in a signal-dependent manner may be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we draw upon recent findings in cells of the immune system to illustrate established as well as emerging ideas of how TET proteins influence cellular function.

    "abstract" : "Background. Obesity and diabetes mellitus significantly increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively affect the survival of these patients. Colorectal cancer and diabetes mellitus share common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Metformin is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide. In addition to its hypoglycemic effect, metformin has anti-tumor effects, which has stimulated interest in researching metformin as a potential method of preventing CRC and slowing its progression. \nPurpose – to highlight the results of studies of the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of metformin in colorectal cancer patients. \nMaterials and methods. Data searches for the review were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Research data published in 2014–2024 were analyzed and systematized. \nResults. Epidemiologic studies of recent decades have shown that patients with T2DM taking metformin have a lower risk of colorectal adenomas and CRC developing and a better prognosis. There is some evidence of a protective role of the drug in patients without diabetes. It was found that the risk of developing CRC depends on the dose and duration of metformin use. Use of metformin is associated with improved survival of patients with both early stages of CRC and metastatic disease. However, some publications have not proven a relationship between metformin use and the risk of CRC and survival of these patients, which requires an analysis of the reasons for these discrepancies. The experience of using metformin in combination with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and immunotherapy in patients with CRC is currently limited to a small number of studies with small patient samples. A moderate improvement in antitumor efficacy was observed with the combination of metformin with 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan in patients with refractory metastatic CRC. Recent studies have shown promising antitumor activity of the combination of metformin with polychemotherapy in CRC treatment. In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with diabetes mellitus, the degree of tumor regression and reduction of lymph node lesion after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy was higher in the group receiving metformin than in the group of patients not using this drug. Similar results were obtained in patients without diabetes. The increase in antitumor activity in the combination of metformin with immune checkpoint blockers observed in preclinical studies, was not confirmed in patients with stage IV microsatellite stable CRC. \nConclusions. Observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality among people receiving metformin. The drug has also been shown to be beneficial for diabetic patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients receiving the combination treatment had better pathologic responses compared to patients who did not take the drug. At the same time, studies of the combined use of metformin with chemotherapeutic drugs are limited mainly to small single-arm trials. Randomized clinical trials with large numbers of CRC patients are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of metformin in combination with standard anticancer treatment."

    "abstract" : "Background Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert a potential clinical enhancing effect in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while antibiotics exert a detrimental impact. Prior meta-analysis papers have substantial limitations and are devoid of recent published studies. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis and, for the first time, assess whether probiotics can restore the damage of antibiotics to immunotherapy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three English databases and three Chinese databases with a cutoff date of August 11, 2024. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) or the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). Engauge Digitizer v12.1 was employed to extract hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for survival outcomes when these data were not explicitly provided in the manuscripts. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 14 software. Results The study sample comprised eight retrospective and four prospective studies, involving a total of 3,142 participants. The findings indicate that probiotics significantly prolong the overall survival (OS) (I2 = 31.2%; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.73, p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (I2 = 65.2%; HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.81, p < 0.001) in cancer patients receiving ICIs, enhance the objective response rate (ORR) (I2 = 33.5%; OR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.40, p = 0.001) and disease control rate (DCR) (I2 = 50.0%; OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.35, p = 0.002). For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exposed to antibiotics, the use of probiotics was associated with superior OS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.34-0.59, p < 0.001) and PFS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.38-0.62, p < 0.001) when compared to non-users. Subgroup differences were observed regarding the cancer type (P=0.006) and ethnic backgrounds (P=0.011) in OS. Conclusions The meta-analysis findings suggest that probiotics can effectively extend the survival of cancer treated with ICIs. In NSCLC, probiotics appear to mitigate the negative impact of antibiotics on immunotherapy effectiveness, which has profound clinical significance. Nevertheless, additional large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to further validate these findings.

Patients with wild-type ARID gene and received ICIs were used as Cohort 2. The outcome differences of the patients between Cohort 1 and 2 were then assessed. Furthermore, patients in Cohort 1 were stratified to subgroups by RNA levels, microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, and the outcomes were analyzed.\n \n \n \n 1.

This review is the first of an annual series exploring the latest in‐patient developments in several key areas, focusing on mechanisms. We present advances in the use and action of several therapies including epigenetic modulators, protein degraders, apoptotic inducers, gene editing, and immunotherapy. We discuss the individual molecular mechanisms and clinical findings of these developments, emphasising their potential to improve survival and offer renewed hope for individuals with blood cancer. Importantly, such novel approaches with testing in patients should lead to further intensive efforts both at basic and translational research levels aiming at effective targeted and immunotherapy in blood cancers."

Among them, 110 cases who received pembrolizumab were randomly split into training set and validation set with a 2:1 ratio. The remaining patients were designated as independent validation cohort. Five multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) panels were developed based on literature review and in-house dataset mining. mIHC tests were performed using baseline tumor samples. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by ORR and PFS (RECIST v1.1). ORR and PFS models were developed using machine learning methods in training set with 5-fold cross-validation and further validated in validation set and independent validation cohort.\n Results: After data cleaning, 68 cases in training set and 34 cases in validation set were further analyzed. In terms of single immune- or spatial- based biomarker, positive rate of PD1+ cells in stroma and spatial relationship of PD1+/PDL1+ cell pairs exhibited the highest correlation with ORR. In addition, positive rate of PDL1+ tumor cells and nearest distance between FOXP3+ cells and tumor cells were highly correlated with PFS. Our ORR model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in the training set and 0.82 in the validation set. When applying optimal cutoff in our PFS model to stratify patients into low- and high- risk groups, low-risk group showed prolonged PFS in both training set (p < 0.0001; HR: 0.25, 95% CI [0.13 - 0.51]) and validation set (p = 0.00046; HR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.09 - 0.55]). Moreover, our ORR model outperformed PDL1 IHC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.60; DeLong’s test p = 0.005) in these 102 patients. Independent validation of the models is still awaited.\n Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we developed and validated ORR and PFS predictive models for first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients based on mIHC technology. Our models displayed superior diagnostic performance compared to PDL1 IHC results.\n Citation Format: Chan Xiang, Jianjian Zheng, Sidong Chen, Zhanxian Shang, Shi Yang, Lianying Guo, Lei Jiao, Yang Wang, Yuchen Han.

    "abstract" : "6021 Background: Currently, the landscape of treating advanced malignancies has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of immunotherapy employing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Notably, several ICIs have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities for individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC). An emerging body of evidence implies a plausible link between body mass index (BMI) and the effectiveness of ICIs in the broader context of cancer patients. Nevertheless, the specific correlation within the subset of head and neck cancer patients undergoing immunotherapeutic interventions remains unclear and warrants meticulous investigation. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched extensively for records published until January 2024. Full-text articles aligned with the research objective were included, while records published in English, case reports, reviews, editorials, and studies reporting immunotherapy combined with other cancer therapies were excluded. The data required for review and analysis was abstracted in Excel files by two independent reviewers. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software, and methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Only six studies were eligible for review and analysis. A subgroup analysis of data from these studies showed that obese HNC patients on immunotherapy had significantly better overall survival (OS) rates than non-obese patients (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 – 0.93; p=0.03). However, the progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically similar between obese and non-obese patients (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 – 1.33; p=0.30). In addition, when BMI was stratified as either low or high, no significant difference was observed in the OS and PFS of HNC patients (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.59 – 1.66; p=0.97 and HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61 – 1.41; p=0.42, respectively). Similarly, the statistical analyses showed that overweight patients have similar OS and PFS as patients with normal BMI (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.15 – 1.92; p=0.33 and HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.20 – 1.52; p = 0.25, respectively). In contrast, underweight patients demonstrated poor OS and PFS (HR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.29 – 5.12; p=0.008 and HR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.17 – 6.52; p=0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Obese HNC patients on immunotherapy tend to have improved OS than non-obese patients, while underweight patients have worse clinical prognoses than those with normal or above BMI."

    "abstract" : "Intorduction. HPV infection stimulates a local immune response, because HPV positivity in cervical cancer places these tumors in a prognostically better group in terms of response to radiotherapy (RT). However, the response to RT treatment in locally advanced cervical cancer depending on the presence of a certain subtype of the HPV virus has been very little investigated in previous research. Taking into account the high incidence rate of cervical cancer in developing countries, where the disease is most often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage, the aim of this review of the available literature was to analyse predictive potential of HPV typing in terms of the response to the RT with/without chemopotentiation as a standard treatment approach. Method. A review of studies dealing with the analysis of the predictive significance of HPV typing in locally advanced cervical cancer patients treated with definitive RT with or without chemopotentiation, from 2000 to 2024, was conducted. Results. Six clinical studies were identified that met the search criteria. The most frequently analyzed subtypes were HPV 16,18,33 and 52. In five studies the HPV 16 subtype was identified in more radioresistant cervical cancers. Conclusion: there is an exceptional clinical importance of HPV typing in order to create an individual treatment strategy, especially in the era of immunotherapy given concurrently with definitive RT. It is also necessary to conduct clinical studies with a large number of patients and consider what the treatment outcomes are depending on the applied RT technique, dose and fractionation regime."

    "abstract" : "\n 465\n \n \n Background:\n Gastric cancer (GC) is associated with significant mortality due to the limited efficacy of current conventional treatments, necessitating the need for novel therapies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore the potential role and outcomes of bi-specific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy in treating GC.\n Methods:\n Using PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrial.gov for 'Gastric cancers', 'bispecific antibodies', and 'CAR-T therapy' as of March 30, 2024. Out of 35 studies, 9 were selected for pooled analysis in R (v4.3.3) using the Der Simonian-Laird Estimator, calculating inter-study variance and extracting data with 95% CI.\n Results:\n 138 gastric cancer (GC) patients from 2 phase I (22.22%), 3 phase Ib (33.33%), 3 phase II (33.33%), and 1 case report (11.11%). Median age was 57 (28-77) years, and 76% (31/41) were male. Bispecific antibodies were MCLA-128 (25/138), catumaxomab (15/138), AK104 PD-1/CTLA-4 (16/138), ABL 001 DLL4VEGFA (19/138), and KN026 (25/138) while CART therapy was CT041 (38/138). The pooled overall response (OR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR) for bispecific antibodies was 37% (95% CI, 0.12-0.71, I2=76%, n=100, p <0.01), 21% (95% CI,0.05-0.55, I2=73%, n=85, p<0.01), and 11%(95% CI, 0.02-0.38, I2=63%, n=85, p=0.03) respectively, while the pooled OR, PR, and CR for CART was 56% (95% CI, 0.40-0.71, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.41), 53%(95% CI, 0.36-0.69, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.38, ), and 12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.42, I2=38%, n=38 p=0.2), respectively. The pooled disease control rate was 75% (95%CI,0.46-0.92, I2=79%, n=80, p < 0.01) for bispecific antibodies and 27% (95% CI,0.16-0.40, I2=0%, n=65, p=0.37) had the stable disease while pooled incidence of progressive disease was 18% (95% CI,0.09-0.31, I2=0%, n=55, p=0.53). The median progressive free survival was 6.74 months, with a median overall survival of 14.75 months. Common adverse effects included anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and cytokine release syndrome grades 1 or 2.\n Conclusions:\n This analysis shows promising results in GC patients using bi-specific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapy. However, further clinical trials are needed to fully explore their potential.\n"

Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, \"Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era.\" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC."

    "abstract" : "Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development."

This review highlights 10 landmark studies from 2024 that address emerging therapies and evolving clinical standards. Immunotherapy remains a central focus, with checkpoint inhibitors redefining the management of solid tumors and showing expanded applications across disease sites and earlier stages of disease. Targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab deruxtecan and enfortumab vedotin, are enhancing precision treatment options in metastatic cancer.

    "abstract" : "ABSTRACT Background Melanoma is one of the most immunogenic malignancies, yet resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a major obstacle to durable therapeutic success. Emerging evidence indicates that aging‐related processes, including cellular senescence and immunosenescence, can reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) to favor immune evasion and disease progression. Senescent melanoma and stromal cells secrete a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that alters immune cell recruitment and function, while immunosenescence leads to diminished cytotoxic responses and the accumulation of dysfunctional or suppressive immune subsets. Aim This review explores the interplay between cellular senescence and immunosenescence in melanoma, highlighting their contributions to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance, and discusses potential strategies to therapeutically target senescence‐related pathways. Methods A systematic review of studies published between 2000 and 2024 was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Literature included mechanistic investigations of senescence in melanoma, analyses of immunosenescence in cancer patients, and preclinical or translational studies targeting senescence‐related pathways. Results and Conclusions Senescent tumor and stromal cells drive a pro‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive TME through SASP, while aging immune cells exhibit impaired antigen presentation, reduced cytotoxicity, and increased suppressive subsets. These dual processes form a self‐reinforcing cycle of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, ultimately undermining the efficacy of ICIs. Targeting senescence, through senolytics, senostatics, or SASP modulators, has shown promise in preclinical models and may restore immune competence in melanoma. However, clinical translation requires further investigation to validate safety and efficacy. Addressing both cellular and immune senescence represents a novel and promising direction to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve melanoma outcomes."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Immunotherapy (IO) has emerged as a promising treatment option shown to improve outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of its efficacy within the older patient population. In this systematic review, we examined randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the response to IO in older patients with TNBC. Methods: We searched Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Central (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The searches combined terms reflecting (1) the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab, durvalumab, and pembrolizumab; (2) breast cancer; and (3) RCTs. Results were limited to publications in English from 2013 to September 2023. Only articles that reported efficacy were included. Risk assessment was performed and overall risk of bias was graded. Two independent reviewers rated each study based on graded scales, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: Our systematic review identified 18 full-text papers on 11 unique RCTs. Only four RCTs presented results for patients 65 and older: KEYNOTE 355, KEYNOTE 522, IMPASSION 130, and IMPASSION 131. Of the first three RCTs, a total of 530 patients out of 2923 patients (18.1%) were 65 and older. The overall risk of bias was rated low or intermediate in all 11 RCTs. In the early-stage TNBC setting, 131 of 1174 patients (11.2%) were 65 and older in KEYNOTE 522. The reported primary endpoint pathological complete response (pCR) was significantly improved in patients in the overall intention to treat (ITT) population in the first interim analysis (IO arm n = 401 patients; control arm n = 201 patients) who received pembrolizumab versus placebo (estimated treatment difference 13.6%, 95% CI 5.4 – 21.8%, p<0.001). Of the 602 total patients, 71 patients (11.8%) were 65 and older (IO arm n = 46; control arm n = 25), the treatment difference was 22.3% (95% CI -2.1 – 43.5%, p=N/A). At the fourth interim analysis (IO arm = 784 patients; control arm = 390), the co-primary endpoint event-free survival (EFS) in ITT was 84.5% at 36 months follow up, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95% CI 0.48 – 0.82, p<0.001). In patients 65 and older, the HR was 0.79 but not statistically significant (95% CI 0.40 – 1.56, p=N/A). In IMPASSION 031, atezolizumab in the early-stage setting was shown to have a significant improvement in the primary endpoint pCR in the ITT population (IO arm n = 165; control arm n = 168; rate difference of 17%, 95% CI 6–27%, one-sided p=0.0044). In the metastatic setting, KEYNOTE 355 showed that for a total of 323 patients with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 10, median OS was 23.0 months in the IO arm compared to 16.1 months in the control arm (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 – 0.95; p=0.0185) at median 44.1 months follow-up. In patients 65 and older with CPS ≥10 (n = 66), median OS was 28.3 months in the IO arm (n= 42) and 12.6 months in the control arm (n= 24) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 – 0.92, p=N/A). In the metastatic setting, atezolizumab has not been shown to significantly improve OS in the ITT overall population or age-specific groups <65 or ≥65 in the final analysis of IMPASSION130. Conclusion: There is a significant gap in data from RCTs evaluating the efficacy of IO in older patients with TNBC. The only FDA-approved IO in TNBC, pembrolizumab, was shown in the early-stage setting to improve pCR and EFS in older patients but was not statistically significant. In the metastatic setting, pembrolizumab significantly improved OS in older patients with CPS ≥10. Both studies had a limited number of patients 65 and older. No other studies reported statistically significant outcomes in patients ≥65. These results underscore the need for further research in older patients.\n Citation Format: Marie Liu, Carrie Sha, Diana Lake, Jasmeet Singh, Mark Robson, W. Iris Zhi.

    "abstract" : "TPS2700 Background: Though immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, when used as monotherapy in the advanced setting, only 18-25% of patients respond to ICI. Notably, ICI frequently lacks anti-tumor activity in immune-cold cancers where T cell priming is missing. Recent breakthroughs in identifying personal neoantigens via a comprehensive analysis of cancer sequencing data have brought increased attention to neoantigen cancer vaccines. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have shown early promise. While neoantigens have recently been investigated in some cancer types, the current neoantigen prediction algorithms have often focused on the MHC class-I subtype, single nucleotide mutations (SNM), small insertions and deletions (INDEL). We recently developed an informatics workflow, REAL-neo, for the identification, quality control (QC), and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound neoantigens that arise from somatic SNM, INDEL, aberrant RNA splicing, and gene fusions, generating much more potent neoantigen candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrated robust T-cell response and prolonged survival by combining ICI and cancer vaccines in preclinical models. This single-arm phase I clinical trial is in progress to assess the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of personalized neoantigen vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid cancers. Methods: The vaccine consists of up to 20 peptides (15-30 mer) comprising patient-specific neoantigens identified from tumor DNA and mRNA sequencing data using REAL-neo and delivered with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. The first cohort of three patients will be treated at dose level 1 consisting of 4 or 5 peptides at 300 mcg/peptide and GM-CSF 125 mcg per injection site in each of four limbs. After Cohort 1 is deemed safe, the study will expand to cohort 2, when patients will be enrolled at the same dose level for vaccine plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. Neoantigen vaccine will be given via subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 21 (cohorts 1 and 2) and weeks 5 and 8 (booster dose for cohort 2 only). Cohort 1 has been completed without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Enrollment in Cohort 2 began in January 2024. AEs are assessed according to CTCAE v5. and safety findings are reviewed by data safety medical board (DSMB). Key eligibility criteria include 1) histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies and 2) cancer progression after at least one line of the standard-of-care (SOC) systemic treatment. For cohort 2, patients must be eligible to receive pembrolizumab per SOC or the treating physician’s judgment. Clinical trial information: NCT05269381 ."

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of different second-line regimens for relapsed ES-SCLC after first-line immuno-chemotherapy.\n Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 96 ES-SCLC patients receiving first-line immuno-chemotherapy in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from Jan 2019 to Dec 2022. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. The clinical outcomes, including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and standard log-rank test.\n Results: From January 4, 2019 to December 18, 2022, a total of 96 ES-SCLC patients received first-line immuno-chemotherapy and 49 of them went through second-line treatment in our center.

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–90% of all lung cancers. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an expanding targeted therapy option for the treatment of NSCLC. The aim is to perform a systematic literature review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of ADCs currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, ClinicalTrial.gov and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Only randomized and non-randomized phase II-IV clinical trials focusing on ADC-based therapies for adult patients affected by NSCLC were selected. The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) were used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in the included randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively. While GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Efficacy endpoints were categorized based on primary outcomes while safety was assessed through the frequency and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), and a qualitative summary of the findings was conducted. Results: A total of seven studies, including three randomized, three non-randomized, and one without specific allocation, were included, comprising 1287 patients, with 693 (54%) men, and an average age of 63 years old. Two studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias, while six had a moderate risk or some concerns. Five ADCs were evaluated: trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), telisotuzumab vedotin, patritumab deruxtecan, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). T-DXd demonstrated superior efficacy in HER2-overexpressing and HER2-mutant NSCLC, with an ORR of 52.9% and 49.0%, respectively. However, HER2-mutant patients exhibited a longer median DOR (16.8 vs. 6.2 months) but a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (38.6% vs. 22%). T-DM1 showed modest efficacy, with an ORR of 20% in HER2-overexpressing NSCLC and 6.7% in HER2-mutant patients. Dato-DXd demonstrated improved ORR (26.4% vs. 12.8%) and PFS (4.4 vs. 3.7 months) compared to docetaxel. Patritumab deruxtecan achieved an ORR of 39% in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while telisotuzumab vedotin exhibited limited activity in c-MET-positive NSCLC (ORR 9%, median DOR 7.5 months). Frequency and severity of TEAEs varied across ADCs, with ILD being a major concern, highlighting the need for strict patient monitoring and early intervention to mitigate severe adverse events. Conclusions: ADCs represent a promising advancement in NSCLC treatment, offering targeted therapeutic options beyond conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. T-DXd has emerged as the most effective ADC for HER2-mutant NSCLC with manageable safety profile, whereas Dato-DXd provides a viable alternative for TROP2-expressing tumors. While ADCs offer significant clinical benefits, careful patient selection and proactive management of adverse events remain crucial. Ongoing and future trials will further refine the role of ADCs in personalized NSCLC treatment, potentially expanding their tumor-agnostic use to broader patient populations."

    "abstract" : "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and metabolically distinct subtype of breast cancer characterized by immune evasion, a high reliance on glycolysis, and poor treatment outcomes. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, there is an urgent need for novel, targeted approaches that integrate immune stimulation with metabolic disruption. This review explores the potential of intratumoral Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) therapy as a dual-action strategy in TNBC, focusing on its ability to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors when simultaneously targeting TNBC’s metabolic vulnerabilities. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying 60 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The selection criteria focused on BCG’s role in oncology, its immunological and metabolic effects, and its application in solid tumors. Studies were assessed for methodological rigor using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles checklist. BCG enhances antitumor immunity by engaging Toll-like receptors, triggering proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-12), and promoting the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. This immune activation reprograms the tumor microenvironment, increasing susceptibility to immunotherapy. Simultaneously, BCG disrupts TNBC’s glycolytic dependence by downregulating hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, forcing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, BCG-induced “trained immunity” epigenetically reprograms innate immune cells, enhancing long-term tumor surveillance and reducing recurrence risk. Intratumoral BCG presents a promising immunometabolic intervention for TNBC by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and disrupting tumor metabolism. Future studies should focus on optimizing its clinical application, developing sustained-release formulations, and exploring synergistic combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and metabolic inhibitors. By addressing TNBC’s dual vulnerabilities, this strategy may redefine treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract" : "Abstract Whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or perioperative chemotherapy is superior for localized esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers has been a topic of long-standing debate. For years, standard of care in the United States for localized esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been physician’s choice between the 2 strategies. More recently, adjuvant immunotherapy has also been introduced into the treatment approach for those who received neoadjuvant CRT. While preoperative radiation remains an important option for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, the ESOPEC trial presented in 2024 suggested that perioperative chemotherapy is superior to preoperative CRT in EAC. In addition, the results of the TOPGEAR trial presented in 2024 showed that adding CRT to perioperative chemotherapy did not lead to improved outcomes. This has led to a shift in practice among oncologists. However, there are various complexities and factors to consider when interpreting these studies. In this review, we outline both trials and what their findings may mean for the future of preoperative CRT in EAC. Ultimately, until more data are available that incorporate novel agents such as immunotherapy, these studies indicate that we should defer the routine inclusion of radiation in preoperative treatment for EAC."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Pembrolizumab is a novel immunotherapy agent that improves oncological outcomes in various cancer types. Although there are minor immune-related adverse events (irAEs) when used alone, various irAEs have been reported when it is combined with chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to investigate irAEs that occurred after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with pembrolizumab based on the KEYNOTE-522 regimen for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to identify fatal irAEs that should be corrected before surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Between 2022 and 2024, a total of, 71 cases from 81 patients who completed NAC with pembrolizumab based on KEYNOTE-522 regimen (wP/Cab and pembrolizumab followed by AC and pembrolizumab) followed by surgery were reviewed based on their medical records. All irAEs that occurred were investigated and classified into five categories: systemic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and endocrine. Underlying diseases that existed before the diagnosis of breast cancer or complications that occurred after surgery were excluded. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.62 (SD, ±10.6) years, and the stages at diagnosis were as follows: IIA (n=23, 32.4%), IIB (n=22, 31.0%), IIIA (n=14, 16.2%), IIIB (n=1, 1.4%), and IIIC (n=11, 15.5%). After NAC with pembrolizumab, the pCR rate was 49.3% (35/71) Fifty-three patients (62.2%) experienced adverse events, and the number of adverse events were as follows: 1 (n=11, 20.8%), 2 (n=20, 37.7%), and ≥3 (n=22, 41.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common (n=46, 86.8%), and dermatologic symptoms were the second most common (n=31, 58.5%). Among fatal irAEs, including colitis and pneumonitis, they occurred in 11 patients (20.8%) and 2 patients (3.8%), respectively. There was no case of hepatitis, myocarditis, or hypophysitis as fatal irAEs after NAC and pembrolizumab for TNBC. Among these irAEs, thyroid disorders (n=16, 22.5%) were the most common adverse event after skin rash and nausea. Of the patients with thyroid disorders, 3 experienced fatal dysfunction. Their surgeries were delayed for an average of 8.5 weeks to correct the thyroid imbalance before they could safely undergo general anesthesia. The remaining patients, who did not experience such complications, were able to undergo surgery after an average of 5.2 weeks. Conclusion: The irAEs that occurred after NAC with pembrolizumab in TNBC were varied and included some that were severe enough to affect the timing of surgery under general anesthesia. Thyroid dysfunction, in particular, should be evaluated and corrected during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy to prevent delays in surgery.\n Citation Format: Byeongju Kang, Jung Eun Choi, Moohyun Lee, Ho Yong Park, Jin Hyang Jung, Soo Jung Lee, Su Hwan Kang, Jin Gu Kang, Sun Hee Kang, Jihyoung Cho, Yee Soo Chae, Soo Jung Lee, In-Hee Lee, Keon Uk Park, Hyera Kim, Jeeyeon Lee.

    "abstract" : "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Currently, programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have become the first choice for breast cancer immunotherapies. Despite paclitaxel being considered a cornerstone drug in breast cancer treatment, the effectiveness, safety, and optimal drug selection for its combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors remain uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, performing a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database through May 18, 2024. Selected trials were those that assessed the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for the treatment of TNBC. The primary endpoint assessed was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), overall response rate (ORR), and Pathological complete response (pCR). This study is registered in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023429651. Results: A total of 8 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria were included, involving 4626 patients who received either Paclitaxel (Paclitaxel-placebo/chemotherapy) or a combination of durvalumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, toripalimab with paclitaxel. The pooled results demonstrated that Durvalumab combined with Paclitaxel significantly reduced the hazard ratio for OS (surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA]: 91.05%) and PFS compared with Paclitaxel alone (SUCRA: 83.52%). Additionally, Durvalumab plus Paclitaxel significantly improved the ORR compared with Paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10–5.20). For safety outcomes, Atezolizumab plus Paclitaxel showed a favorable profile in AEs, with no significant differences observed between groups. In the pCR study, Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel was the most effective treatment option (SUCRA: 81.85%). Conclusions: When combined with paclitaxel, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibit a favorable survival benefit. The combination of Durvalumab and paclitaxel represents the optimal treatment option. In the future, attention should be paid to the TNBC subtypes and drug dosage, as these factors may help to design personalized TNBC treatment programs."

    "abstract" : "RATIONALE\nPreserving health-related quality of life is an aspect of care that requires constant attention from the time of cancer diagnosis. Melatonin has been used to diminish treatment-related side effects and cancer symptoms, and as a medication to regulate circadian rhythm. An up-to-date systematic review is needed to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nTo identify studies for inclusion in this review, we used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and four trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 10 September 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer of any stage that evaluated melatonin (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment) versus no treatment or placebo (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment), or standard anticancer treatment. Standard anticancer treatment refers to treatments to stop or prevent cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and sleep quality within three months, and melatonin-related adverse events. Other outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, tumour response, and anticancer treatment-related harms.\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies included in the review.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If this was not possible, due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results in a narrative format. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe identified 30 RCTs (reported in 49 publications) involving 5093 adult participants with cancer (2470 males, 2228 females, 395 not reported). Studies were conducted in a hospital setting and took place in at least 10 countries. We assessed two studies at low risk of bias and the other 28 at high risk of bias.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nMelatonin plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life score (MD 2.60, 95% CI -14.53 to 19.73; 1 study, 126 participants; very low certainty evidence), and sleep score (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.42; 1 study, 50 participants; very low certainty evidence) within three months. We are also very uncertain about potential adverse effects of melatonin: headache (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 23.14; 1 study, 25 participants; very low certainty evidence); fatigue (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 2 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty evidence); and nausea (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.56; 1 study, 146 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of high risk of bias, small sample size, the width of the 95% confidence interval, and indirectness due to inadequate reporting of cancer type. Melatonin plus standard treatment versus standard treatment No data are available relating to quality of life and sleep within three months. The evidence is very uncertain about headaches (experienced by 15 of 820 participants in melatonin groups, with no data available for control groups; 2 studies, 1640 participants; very low certainty evidence). Melatonin likely reduces the incidence of fatigue (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.55; 10 studies, 1359 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00; 6 studies, 710 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Melatonin (topical use) plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life (one study reported no difference between groups, both having the same median score of 66.7; 48 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to sleep and adverse events (including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias, small sample size, and insufficient data.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe available evidence is of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving treatment for cancer. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Data were lacking for some outcomes, such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. Since the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited due to insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, the decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment cannot easily be made at the current time.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by AG Biologische Krebstherapie, Deutsche Krebshilfe (grant numbers 70-301 and 109863). The funding agency had no role in the design or conduct of the study.\n\n\nREGISTRATION\nThe protocol for this review is available via DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD010145."

    "abstract" : "Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very common type of head and neck cancer, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 50%. Inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway have gained widespread clinical adoption. However, the relationship between the infiltration characteristics of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effect of immunotherapy on HNSCC remains to be explored. Methods Patients diagnosed with HNSCC who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy were reviewed between February 2021 and March 30, 2024, in our single center. The laryngoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathologic response were evaluated to the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Result Our analysis involved 42 patients who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients underwent surgical treatment following the completion of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Among them, 6 patients achieved pCR (33%). The 1-year OS rate of the 42 patients enrolled in the study was 95.05%, and the 1-year PFS rate was 89.86%. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphocyte density in HNSCC prior to the administration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy efficacy. Compared with pretreatment, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly decreased, and the lymphocyte density was significantly increased in HNSCC patients after immunotherapy. Conclusions The integration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective strategy, can improve the tumor response rate and survival rate, and is a valuable treatment for patients with HNSCC. Furthermore, the study suggests that an elevated NLR within the HNSCC tumor microenvironment could potentially serve as a biomarker indicative of diminished immunotherapy efficacy.

    "abstract" : "\n e20593\n \n \n Background:\n Tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is emerging as a promising immunotherapy agent and has demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability in recent lung cancer trials. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of Tislelizumab, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy (Group 1), as a superior treatment alternative for lung cancer compared to standard chemotherapy (Group 2) in improving patient outcomes.\n Methods:\n Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to December 2024 to identify Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Hazards ratio (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) were generated, by employing a Random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Our outcomes of interest were Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of response (DOR), and treatment-related adverse Events.\n Results:\n A total of 6 RCTs involving 2107 patients were included for analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that Group 1 significantly improved PFS, OS, and DOR with HRs of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.71-1.99; p <0.00001, I² = 0%), 2.01 (95% CI: 1.75-2.29; p <0.00001, I² = 0%) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.52-3.03; p <0.0001, I² = 39%), respectively. Group 1 has better DCR and ORR compared to Group 2 with RRs of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12-2.07; p= 0.007, I² = 97%) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.20-1.86; p= 0.0003, I² = 83%), respectively. The high heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis of DCR (I² = 97%) and ORR (I² = 83%) likely reflects variability in study populations, treatment protocols, and response assessment criteria across the included RCTs. Subgroup or sensitivity analyses could help identify contributing factors. Despite the heterogeneity, the pooled effect sizes indicate a statistically significant improvement in DCR and ORR with Tislelizumab, with caution warranted when generalizing these findings. Group 1 significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared to Group 2 (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.95; p = 0.0003), with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%). No significant differences were found in adverse events, except for ALT elevations. (RR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14–1.61; p = 0.0006, I² = 25%).\n Conclusions:\n Tislelizumab, with or without chemotherapy, demonstrates greater PFS and OS benefits compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with lung cancer. There was a significantly reduced all-cause mortality in the intervention group; however, the observed increase in the risk of ALT elevation underscores the need for vigilant liver function monitoring. When combined with chemotherapy, Tislelizumab presents a promising treatment option for lung cancer.\n"

Here we report the results of primary analysis. Methods: WU-KONG1 Part B is a phase 2, multinational pivotal study to assess the antitumor efficacy of sunvozertinib at two dose levels, 200 mg and 300 mg, in platinum pre-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon20ins. Eligible patients were randomized at the ratio of 1:1 to receive 200 mg or 300 mg sunvozertinib once daily until discontinuation criteria were met. Randomization was stratified by brain metastasis at baseline and number of regimens of prior systemic anti-cancer therapy. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) (per RECIST v1.1) and key secondary endpoint included IRC assessed duration of response (DoR). Results: As of January 4, 2024, a total of 184 patients were randomized to receive sunvozertinib treatment at 200 mg or 300 mg. Patients who met the predefined criteria for efficacy analysis were included in the primary analysis. The majority of patients (96.0%) had metastatic diseases, 60.7% had ECOG PS of 1, and 23.7% had baseline brain metastasis. All patients received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and 43.4% and 13.3% had prior onco-immunotherapy or amivantamab treatment. Per IRC assessment, the best ORR was 54.3% (41.0% confirmed and 5.8% pending confirmation). Confirmed complete response (CR) was achieved in 2.9% patients. The disease control rate (including CR, PR and stable disease) was 90.8%. The primary endpoint met its predefined target, with statistical significance. Tumor response was observed in patients with baseline brain metastasis, different demographics and EGFR exon20ins subtypes. With median follow-up time of 5.5 months for responders, the duration of response has not been reached, with 74.6% responders still responding. The PFS data are not mature with approximately 6-month follow-up. Safety findings were similar to previously reported results of sunvozertinib in other clinical studies. The most common drug-related TEAEs included diarrhea, skin rash and CPK increase. The majority of the TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and clinically manageable. Conclusions: In this primary analysis of WU-KONG1 multinational pivotal study, sunvozertinib demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in platinum pre-treated NSCLC with EGFR exon20ins, with a tolerable safety profile. The updated data will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT03974022 ."

The development of increasingly potent cancer treatments has helped to improve cancer survival, but at the potential cost of cardiovascular toxicity. These cardiovascular complications can occur during or after cancer treatment, in short, medium or long term. This study aims to provide an overview of the clinical activity of the first nurse-led cardio-oncology clinic in the United Kingdom.\n \n \n \n This is a single centre, retrospective, observational cohort study reviewing our cardio-oncology clinic activity from 2023 to 2024. Patients receiving cancer treatment were included if they were referred to the nurse-led clinic for treatment and management of their cardiovascular condition before, during or after treatment.\n \n \n \n 534 patients were seen in the nurse-led Cardio-Oncology clinic, 102 of these patients were new referrals who were then followed up throughout the year from 2023-2024. The mean age of the patients was 65+14 years old and 46 (45%) were male. Amongst the new referrals, haematological and breast malignancies were most common (27.4% and 30.3% respectively), followed by lung and sarcoma malignancies (both 7.8%). Eighteen (17.6%) were treated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies, 23.5% of patient received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Seven (6.8%) received immunotherapy, 10 (9.8%) received radiotherapy, 8 patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 (2.9%) received taxane, 5 (5.8%) were treated with 5FU and 1 (0.9%) CDKi inhibitor. Six (5.8%) patients had surgery and two (1.9%) underwent stem cell transplants. Six (5.8%) patients had combination therapy and 8 (7.8%) had other disease-specific treatments.\n Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) was most common cardiovascular complication in 33 (32.3%) of patients referred, then 14 cases of (13.7%) HF with preserved EF, arrhythmia in 12 (11.7%), 10 (9.8%) presented with chest pain, 15 (14.7%) treated for hypertension and 9 (8.8%) referred prior to chemotherapy.\n More than half of the HF referrals (30.3%) resulted from cancer treatment-related heart dysfunction.\n Sixty-two (60.7%) patients referred were only having nurse-led follow-up in the Cardio-Oncology clinic and were no longer being seen in the doctor’s clinic. Forty-two (41.1%) continued cardiotoxic cancer treatment with monitoring in nurse-led clinic and 12 (11.7%) patients died due to cancer disease progression.\n \n \n \n The Cardio-Oncology nurse-led clinic encompasses holistic patient care and permits rapid up-titration of medications to optimal target dosages, resulting in treatment of cardiovascular conditions thus significant improvements in cardiac function, education, and support of side effect management. This allows uninterrupted continuation of cancer treatment, with the potential to translate into better long-term cancer and cardiovascular outcomes.  Figure 1table continued\n"

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (mTLS) predict improved outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, a significant proportion of patients with TLS-positive tumors do not respond to ICI when used as a single agent and may therefore benefit from combination therapy. The multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, deplete regulatory T cells, an immune population associated with resistance to ICI in TLS-positive tumors. We report the results of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab combined with regorafenib in patients with mTLS-positive advanced solid tumors.\n Methods: ‘Regomune’ is an open-label, multicenter phase II study assessing the combination of avelumab (10mg/kg IV every 14 days) with regorafenib (160 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle) in patients with advanced mTLS-positive solid tumors. The mTLS status was centrally assessed as previously described (Vanhersecke et al Nature Cancer 2021). All patients had confirmed progressive disease at inclusion, based on a central review of imaging. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 6-month non-progression rate using RECIST v1.1 based on blinded central review. 29 assessable patients were deemed necessary, and to meet the primary endpoint, at least 8 patients needed to be progression-free at 6 months.\n Results: Between January 2021 and July 2022, 132 patients (5 centers) underwent mTLS screening. Of these, 55 (41.7%) were identified as mTLS+, and 38 were included in the study. The top five histological subtypes were MSS colorectal cancer (15.8%), sarcoma (13.1%), oesogastric (10.5%), biliary tract (7.9%), and pancreatic cancer (7.9%). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (23.7%), maculo-papular rash (18.4%), fatigue, and oral mucositis (7.9% each). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Of the 34 patients assessed for efficacy, 16 (47%) showed tumor shrinkage, with 9 achieving a partial response (26.7%) and 7 having stable disease (20.6%). The median duration of response was 6 months. Twelve patients (comprising various tumor types including MSS colorectal cancer, small bowel carcinomas, biliary tract cancer, sarcomas, thyroid and gynecological tumors.) were progression-free at 6 months, marking the study’s primary endpoint achievement. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.6 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of tumor tissues, and comprehensive plasma proteomics analysis have collectively uncovered critical biomarkers that significantly determine both sensitivity and resistance to treatment.\n Conclusions: This is the first histology-agnostic clinical trial employing mTLS as a biomarker for patient selection for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen. Durable responses were recorded, even in cases typically resistant to immunotherapy, confirming the predictive value of mTLS.\n Trial Registration NCT03475953\n Citation Format: Antoine Italiano, Sophie Cousin, Carine Bellera, Jean-Philippe Guegan, Jean-Philippe Metges, Antoine Adenis, Rastilav Bahleda, Philippe Cassier, Coralie Cantarel, Michele Kind, Jean Palussiere, Lucile Vanhersecke, Alban Bessede.

Долгое время адъювантная химиотерапия оставалась единственной лекарственной опцией адъювантного лечения пациентов с немелкоклеточным раком лёгкого (НМРЛ) IB–IIIA стадий. Необходимость открытия новых подходов в адъювантном лечении НМРЛ, безусловно, связана с невысокими результатами общей выживаемости и с высоким риском рецидива рака лёгкого после проведения исключительно химиотерапии.

For a long time, adjuvant chemotherapy remained the only drug option for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IB–IIIA. The necessity to discover new approaches to the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC is certainly associated with low overall survival results and a high risk of lung cancer relapse after chemotherapy alone. In the course of the evolution of knowledge about tumor biology, molecular mechanisms of cancer development and spread, two new areas of adjuvant therapy have emerged - targeted and immunotherapy. This review discusses phase III studies, the results of which demonstrated improved survival rates in patients who received innovative adjuvant therapy, which made it possible to introduce new options for adjuvant therapy for NSCLC into clinical practice. The timeframes for the implementation of these options in practical recommendations are also reflected."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with global impact, especially in the context of the rising epidemic of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape for HCC is evolving and has changed significantly in the last few years with new treatment options for patients, while the multidisciplinary team model of care remains critical. This review aims to summarize the various treatment options for patients at all stages of HCC, highlighting the growing array of systemic therapies with multi-modal options, including the potential of combining locoregional therapies with immunotherapy across different stages of the disease. With the increasing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, the future paradigm of HCC care includes the incorporation of non-hospice palliative care in the multidisciplinary team care model to improve patient quality of care, quality of life, and overall outcomes. Abstract Liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes up the majority of liver cancer cases. Despite the stabilization of incidence rates in recent years due to effective viral hepatitis treatments, as well as improved outcomes from early detection and treatment advances, the burden of HCC is anticipated to rise again due to increasing rates of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape is evolving and requires a multidisciplinary approach, often involving multi-modal treatments that include surgical resection, transplantation, local regional therapies, and systemic treatments. The optimal approach to the care of the HCC patient requires a multidisciplinary team involving hepatology, medical oncology, diagnostic and interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and surgery. In order to determine which approach is best, an individualized treatment plan should consider the patient’s liver function, functional status, comorbidities, cancer stage, and preferences. In this review, we provide an overview of the current treatment options and key trials that have revolutionized the management of HCC. We also discuss evolving treatment paradigms for the future."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, requiring new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This research arises from the need to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The authors aim to systematically evaluate the potential of emerging biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNAs and mutational load of blood tumors and their relationship with different treatments. The findings of this study could have a significant impact on the research community by providing a basis for integrating these biomarkers into clinical practice, thereby improving personalized treatment strategies and patient outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. Abstract Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, often diagnosed at advanced stages, which diminishes the effective treatment options and survival rates. This systematic review assesses the utility of emerging biomarkers—circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB)—enhanced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the diagnostic accuracy, prognostic evaluation, and treatment strategies in NSCLC. Analyzing data from 37 studies involving 10,332 patients from 2020 to 2024, the review highlights how biomarkers like ctDNA and PD-L1 expression critically inform the selection of personalized therapies, particularly beneficial in the advanced stages of NSCLC. These biomarkers are critical for prognostic assessments and in dynamically adapting treatment plans, where high PD-L1 expression and specific genetic mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, EGFR mutations) significantly guide the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The findings recommend integrating these biomarkers into standardized clinical pathways to maximize their potential in enhancing the treatment precision, ultimately fostering significant advancements in oncology and improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review substantiates the prognostic and predictive value of these biomarkers and emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation in biomarker research."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: The treatment algorithm following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) remains uncertain. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and the first network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs (or combined new drugs) for the treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive/HER2-Negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with CDK4/6i. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched from 2000 to 2024 and conference proceedings from major congresses of the last two years were retrieved. Two authors independently performed the screening, three authors extracted data, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) as secondary endpoints. The new drugs (or combined new drugs) were compared to either standard chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy alone (ET) in second-line and beyond treatment settings. Network meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, calculating risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and chi-square test. Results: A total of 4034 papers were identified, after removing duplicates. Out of the 67 studies screened in full-text, 26 clinical trials were selected, encompassing a total of 7083 patients and five different drug classes. Specifically, 9 studies included biological agnostic therapy (CDK4/6i, mTOR inhibitors, immunotherapy), 7 novel ET (including selective estrogen receptor degraders – oral SERD), 5 targeted therapies (PI3K, AKT and PARP inhibitors), 3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs: trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd] and sacituzumab govitecan), and 2 CT (eribulin, VEX metronomic). Control arms consisted of either ET alone (mainly fulvestrant) or standard CT (paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All network estimates coincided with pairwise estimates as no direct comparison between the new drugs existed in the literature. Among all therapies, T-DXd showed the largest PFS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.51 (CI: 0.45 – 0.57)], followed by ribociclib plus ET compared to ET alone [HR 0.57 (CI: 0.45 – 0.72)]. Interaction tests conducted among the five drug classes showed a significant different positive effect on PFS by targeted therapies [HR 0.61 (CI: 0.57 – 0.66)] compared to ET alone (p-value 0.009) but failed to identify significant differences in PFS among the different drug classes compared to CT (p-value 0.16), although ADCs showed a larger effect in PFS [HR 0.63 (CI: 0.50 – 0.80)]. Although ADCs showed the largest OS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.72 (CI: 0.58 – 0.89)], the interaction test among the drug classes was not significant (p-value 0.10), and similarly no interaction was observed for ORR. Conversely, the interaction test for toxicity indicates a significant difference between the five drug classes compared to ET, with biological agnostic therapy showing greater toxicity [HR 4.81 (CI: 3.18 – 7.25)] compared to other treatment options. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis showed that targeted therapies, such as PI3K, AKT, and PARP inhibitors, demonstrate significant improvement in PFS compared to ET with a positive interaction test among the different drug classes. Biological agnostic therapies offer some survival improvement but at the cost of increased toxicity as compared to other options. These findings could help tailor the most suitable treatment for each patient, determining the optimal sequence following progression to CDK4/6i for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC.\n Citation Format: Mariangela Gaudio, Michela Cinquini, Flavia Jacobs, Cristina Mazzi, Valter Torri, Antonino Carmelo Tralongo, Chiara Benvenuti, Riccardo Gerosa, Jacopo Canzian, Giuseppe Saltalamacchia, Rita de Sanctis, Armando Santoro, Alberto Zambelli.

    "abstract" : "\n Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 amplification. This unique molecular profile limits treatment options, as TNBC does not respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies, making chemotherapy the cornerstone of systemic treatment. Achieving a complete pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved long-term outcomes and survival rates in TNBC patients. However, pCR rates can vary significantly depending on the chemotherapy regimen used, as well as the inclusion of other modalities such as immunotherapy. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted at Chihuahua's State Cancer Center, where medical records of patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with TNBC between January 2012 and June 2023 were reviewed to evaluate pCR after neoadjuvant treatment. The study compared the effectiveness of three chemotherapy regimens: anthracyclines and taxanes (AC-T), anthracyclines combined with taxanes and carboplatin (AC-Tcarboplatin), and any chemotherapy regimen paired with immunotherapy (IT). Fisher's exact tests were used to compare pCR rates across these groups, with p-values calculated to determine clinical significance and identify the most effective treatment strategies. In total, 1279 breast cancer patients were included, with 182 (14.23%) diagnosed with TNBC. Among these, 92 (50.55%) received neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in 35 (19.23%) achieving pCR. Upon observing the pCR rates among different regimens, we found clinical relevance in the variations. Statistically significant differences were confirmed when comparing neoadjuvant treatments in relation to pCR rates (p=0.029). Sixty patients received the AC-T regimen, achieving a pCR rate of 26.67%. Thirteen patients received AC-Tcarboplatin, with a pCR rate of 46.15%. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, showing a high pCR rate of 92.31%. Finally, 6 patients received other chemotherapy regimens without immunotherapy or carboplatin, with only 1 (16.67%) achieving pCR.This analysis highlights significant differences in pCR rates depending on the administered treatment, emphasizing firstly the clear benefits of adding carboplatin to the neoadjuvant regimen. Additionally, although the number of patients treated with immunotherapy was limited, the results unequivocally indicate its benefit in significantly enhancing complete pathological responses compared to other treatment groups. While each therapeutic group demonstrated specific advantages in pCR rates, stressing the critical importance of early access to advanced therapeutic options such as immunotherapy from the time of TNBC diagnosis is crucial. Finally, it is recommended to establish better public policies to improve access to these treatments and explore the potential additional benefits of low-dose immunotherapy in future research to further optimize clinical outcomes.\n Citation Format: Enrique José Zamudio Lozoya, Luisa Fernanda González-González, Victor Baylon-Valdez, Paolo Mendoza-Muraira, Regina Martínez-García-Lascurain, Patricio Ochoa Elizondo, Rafael Martínez-Sanciprián, Beatriz De León-Jiménez, Alma Andrea Elizaldi-San Miguel, Gustavo Gil Reza Bravo, América Susana Mares García, René Lázaro González-Mendoza.

    "abstract" : "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are iron-dependent and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). All three epigenetic modifications are intermediates in DNA demethylation. TET proteins are recruited by transcription factors and by RNA polymerase II to modify 5mC at enhancers and gene bodies, thereby regulating gene expression during development, cell lineage specification, and cell activation. It is not yet clear, however, how the established biochemical activities of TET enzymes in oxidizing 5mC and mediating DNA demethylation relate to the known association of TET deficiency with inflammation, clonal hematopoiesis, and cancer. There are hints that the ability of TET deficiency to promote cell proliferation in a signal-dependent manner may be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we draw upon recent findings in cells of the immune system to illustrate established as well as emerging ideas of how TET proteins influence cellular function.

    "abstract" : "Background. Obesity and diabetes mellitus significantly increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively affect the survival of these patients. Colorectal cancer and diabetes mellitus share common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Metformin is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide. In addition to its hypoglycemic effect, metformin has anti-tumor effects, which has stimulated interest in researching metformin as a potential method of preventing CRC and slowing its progression. \nPurpose – to highlight the results of studies of the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of metformin in colorectal cancer patients. \nMaterials and methods. Data searches for the review were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Research data published in 2014–2024 were analyzed and systematized. \nResults. Epidemiologic studies of recent decades have shown that patients with T2DM taking metformin have a lower risk of colorectal adenomas and CRC developing and a better prognosis. There is some evidence of a protective role of the drug in patients without diabetes. It was found that the risk of developing CRC depends on the dose and duration of metformin use. Use of metformin is associated with improved survival of patients with both early stages of CRC and metastatic disease. However, some publications have not proven a relationship between metformin use and the risk of CRC and survival of these patients, which requires an analysis of the reasons for these discrepancies. The experience of using metformin in combination with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and immunotherapy in patients with CRC is currently limited to a small number of studies with small patient samples. A moderate improvement in antitumor efficacy was observed with the combination of metformin with 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan in patients with refractory metastatic CRC. Recent studies have shown promising antitumor activity of the combination of metformin with polychemotherapy in CRC treatment. In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with diabetes mellitus, the degree of tumor regression and reduction of lymph node lesion after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy was higher in the group receiving metformin than in the group of patients not using this drug. Similar results were obtained in patients without diabetes. The increase in antitumor activity in the combination of metformin with immune checkpoint blockers observed in preclinical studies, was not confirmed in patients with stage IV microsatellite stable CRC. \nConclusions. Observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality among people receiving metformin. The drug has also been shown to be beneficial for diabetic patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients receiving the combination treatment had better pathologic responses compared to patients who did not take the drug. At the same time, studies of the combined use of metformin with chemotherapeutic drugs are limited mainly to small single-arm trials. Randomized clinical trials with large numbers of CRC patients are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of metformin in combination with standard anticancer treatment."

    "abstract" : "Background Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert a potential clinical enhancing effect in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while antibiotics exert a detrimental impact. Prior meta-analysis papers have substantial limitations and are devoid of recent published studies. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis and, for the first time, assess whether probiotics can restore the damage of antibiotics to immunotherapy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three English databases and three Chinese databases with a cutoff date of August 11, 2024. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) or the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). Engauge Digitizer v12.1 was employed to extract hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for survival outcomes when these data were not explicitly provided in the manuscripts. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 14 software. Results The study sample comprised eight retrospective and four prospective studies, involving a total of 3,142 participants. The findings indicate that probiotics significantly prolong the overall survival (OS) (I2 = 31.2%; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.73, p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (I2 = 65.2%; HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.81, p < 0.001) in cancer patients receiving ICIs, enhance the objective response rate (ORR) (I2 = 33.5%; OR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.40, p = 0.001) and disease control rate (DCR) (I2 = 50.0%; OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.35, p = 0.002). For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exposed to antibiotics, the use of probiotics was associated with superior OS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.34-0.59, p < 0.001) and PFS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.38-0.62, p < 0.001) when compared to non-users. Subgroup differences were observed regarding the cancer type (P=0.006) and ethnic backgrounds (P=0.011) in OS. Conclusions The meta-analysis findings suggest that probiotics can effectively extend the survival of cancer treated with ICIs. In NSCLC, probiotics appear to mitigate the negative impact of antibiotics on immunotherapy effectiveness, which has profound clinical significance. Nevertheless, additional large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to further validate these findings.

Accumulating research suggests that patients with ARID gene alterations of the human switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complex are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. To investigate the correlation between ARID gene alterations/RNA expression levels and clinical outcomes after immunotherapies, we reviewed patients with solid malignancies seen at our Institute.\n \n \n \n A review of patients (from 2014 to 2024) with solid malignancies from our clinical database at the Avera Cancer Institute, whose tissue DNA and RNA were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) by Tempus and Foundation Medicine, Inc. Patients who have alterations in the ARID gene (ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2 and ARID5B) and received therapeutic regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors) alone or in combination with other treatments were assembled as Cohort 1. Patients with wild-type ARID gene and received ICIs were used as Cohort 2. The outcome differences of the patients between Cohort 1 and 2 were then assessed. Furthermore, patients in Cohort 1 were stratified to subgroups by RNA levels, microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, and the outcomes were analyzed.\n \n \n \n 1. Of the 3620 patients in our database, we found 591 (16.3%) patients harboring ARID gene alterations with one of 15 types of cancer. This includes 160 (4.4% of 3620 and 27.1% of 591 patients) patients (Cohort 1) that received ICIs (excluding 10 patients unevaluable due to treatment termination per drug toxicity or lack of follow-up information), and 470 (13.0%) patients (Cohort 2) with wild-type ARID gene received ICIs. 2.

In 2024–2025, emerging targeted therapies promise improved results with reduced adverse effects. This review is the first of an annual series exploring the latest in‐patient developments in several key areas, focusing on mechanisms. We present advances in the use and action of several therapies including epigenetic modulators, protein degraders, apoptotic inducers, gene editing, and immunotherapy. We discuss the individual molecular mechanisms and clinical findings of these developments, emphasising their potential to improve survival and offer renewed hope for individuals with blood cancer. Importantly, such novel approaches with testing in patients should lead to further intensive efforts both at basic and translational research levels aiming at effective targeted and immunotherapy in blood cancers."

Recent studies have elucidated a strong relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using single-cell multi-omics technology. In this study, we aim to develop predictive models for both objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) using TIME features with machine learning in advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line immunotherapy.\n Methods: A total of 210 patients with advanced NSCLC who received anti-PD-1/PDL-1 therapy at Shanghai Chest Hospital from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2023 were included in this study. Among them, 110 cases who received pembrolizumab were randomly split into training set and validation set with a 2:1 ratio. The remaining patients were designated as independent validation cohort. Five multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) panels were developed based on literature review and in-house dataset mining. mIHC tests were performed using baseline tumor samples. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by ORR and PFS (RECIST v1.1). ORR and PFS models were developed using machine learning methods in training set with 5-fold cross-validation and further validated in validation set and independent validation cohort.\n Results: After data cleaning, 68 cases in training set and 34 cases in validation set were further analyzed. In terms of single immune- or spatial- based biomarker, positive rate of PD1+ cells in stroma and spatial relationship of PD1+/PDL1+ cell pairs exhibited the highest correlation with ORR. In addition, positive rate of PDL1+ tumor cells and nearest distance between FOXP3+ cells and tumor cells were highly correlated with PFS. Our ORR model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in the training set and 0.82 in the validation set. When applying optimal cutoff in our PFS model to stratify patients into low- and high- risk groups, low-risk group showed prolonged PFS in both training set (p < 0.0001; HR: 0.25, 95% CI [0.13 - 0.51]) and validation set (p = 0.00046; HR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.09 - 0.55]). Moreover, our ORR model outperformed PDL1 IHC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.60; DeLong’s test p = 0.005) in these 102 patients. Independent validation of the models is still awaited.\n Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we developed and validated ORR and PFS predictive models for first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients based on mIHC technology.

    "abstract" : "6021 Background: Currently, the landscape of treating advanced malignancies has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of immunotherapy employing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Notably, several ICIs have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities for individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC). An emerging body of evidence implies a plausible link between body mass index (BMI) and the effectiveness of ICIs in the broader context of cancer patients. Nevertheless, the specific correlation within the subset of head and neck cancer patients undergoing immunotherapeutic interventions remains unclear and warrants meticulous investigation. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched extensively for records published until January 2024. Full-text articles aligned with the research objective were included, while records published in English, case reports, reviews, editorials, and studies reporting immunotherapy combined with other cancer therapies were excluded. The data required for review and analysis was abstracted in Excel files by two independent reviewers. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software, and methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Only six studies were eligible for review and analysis. A subgroup analysis of data from these studies showed that obese HNC patients on immunotherapy had significantly better overall survival (OS) rates than non-obese patients (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 – 0.93; p=0.03). However, the progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically similar between obese and non-obese patients (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 – 1.33; p=0.30). In addition, when BMI was stratified as either low or high, no significant difference was observed in the OS and PFS of HNC patients (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.59 – 1.66; p=0.97 and HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61 – 1.41; p=0.42, respectively). Similarly, the statistical analyses showed that overweight patients have similar OS and PFS as patients with normal BMI (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.15 – 1.92; p=0.33 and HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.20 – 1.52; p = 0.25, respectively). In contrast, underweight patients demonstrated poor OS and PFS (HR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.29 – 5.12; p=0.008 and HR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.17 – 6.52; p=0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Obese HNC patients on immunotherapy tend to have improved OS than non-obese patients, while underweight patients have worse clinical prognoses than those with normal or above BMI."

    "abstract" : "Intorduction. HPV infection stimulates a local immune response, because HPV positivity in cervical cancer places these tumors in a prognostically better group in terms of response to radiotherapy (RT). However, the response to RT treatment in locally advanced cervical cancer depending on the presence of a certain subtype of the HPV virus has been very little investigated in previous research. Taking into account the high incidence rate of cervical cancer in developing countries, where the disease is most often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage, the aim of this review of the available literature was to analyse predictive potential of HPV typing in terms of the response to the RT with/without chemopotentiation as a standard treatment approach. Method. A review of studies dealing with the analysis of the predictive significance of HPV typing in locally advanced cervical cancer patients treated with definitive RT with or without chemopotentiation, from 2000 to 2024, was conducted. Results. Six clinical studies were identified that met the search criteria. The most frequently analyzed subtypes were HPV 16,18,33 and 52. In five studies the HPV 16 subtype was identified in more radioresistant cervical cancers. Conclusion: there is an exceptional clinical importance of HPV typing in order to create an individual treatment strategy, especially in the era of immunotherapy given concurrently with definitive RT. It is also necessary to conduct clinical studies with a large number of patients and consider what the treatment outcomes are depending on the applied RT technique, dose and fractionation regime."

    "abstract" : "\n 465\n \n \n Background:\n Gastric cancer (GC) is associated with significant mortality due to the limited efficacy of current conventional treatments, necessitating the need for novel therapies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore the potential role and outcomes of bi-specific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy in treating GC.\n Methods:\n Using PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrial.gov for 'Gastric cancers', 'bispecific antibodies', and 'CAR-T therapy' as of March 30, 2024. Out of 35 studies, 9 were selected for pooled analysis in R (v4.3.3) using the Der Simonian-Laird Estimator, calculating inter-study variance and extracting data with 95% CI.\n Results:\n 138 gastric cancer (GC) patients from 2 phase I (22.22%), 3 phase Ib (33.33%), 3 phase II (33.33%), and 1 case report (11.11%). Median age was 57 (28-77) years, and 76% (31/41) were male. Bispecific antibodies were MCLA-128 (25/138), catumaxomab (15/138), AK104 PD-1/CTLA-4 (16/138), ABL 001 DLL4VEGFA (19/138), and KN026 (25/138) while CART therapy was CT041 (38/138). The pooled overall response (OR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR) for bispecific antibodies was 37% (95% CI, 0.12-0.71, I2=76%, n=100, p <0.01), 21% (95% CI,0.05-0.55, I2=73%, n=85, p<0.01), and 11%(95% CI, 0.02-0.38, I2=63%, n=85, p=0.03) respectively, while the pooled OR, PR, and CR for CART was 56% (95% CI, 0.40-0.71, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.41), 53%(95% CI, 0.36-0.69, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.38, ), and 12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.42, I2=38%, n=38 p=0.2), respectively. The pooled disease control rate was 75% (95%CI,0.46-0.92, I2=79%, n=80, p < 0.01) for bispecific antibodies and 27% (95% CI,0.16-0.40, I2=0%, n=65, p=0.37) had the stable disease while pooled incidence of progressive disease was 18% (95% CI,0.09-0.31, I2=0%, n=55, p=0.53). The median progressive free survival was 6.74 months, with a median overall survival of 14.75 months. Common adverse effects included anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and cytokine release syndrome grades 1 or 2.\n Conclusions:\n This analysis shows promising results in GC patients using bi-specific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapy. However, further clinical trials are needed to fully explore their potential.\n"

Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, \"Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era.\" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC."

    "abstract" : "Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development."

This review highlights 10 landmark studies from 2024 that address emerging therapies and evolving clinical standards. Immunotherapy remains a central focus, with checkpoint inhibitors redefining the management of solid tumors and showing expanded applications across disease sites and earlier stages of disease. Targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab deruxtecan and enfortumab vedotin, are enhancing precision treatment options in metastatic cancer. Meanwhile, advances in supportive care, such as magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate cancer screening, ponsegromab for cachexia, and celiac plexus radiosurgery for pain, show enhanced symptom management and quality of life for patients. These innovations highlight the critical role of multidisciplinary approaches, where internal medicine physicians contribute to co-management and toxicity monitoring, ultimately optimizing patient care.

    "abstract" : "ABSTRACT Background Melanoma is one of the most immunogenic malignancies, yet resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a major obstacle to durable therapeutic success. Emerging evidence indicates that aging‐related processes, including cellular senescence and immunosenescence, can reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) to favor immune evasion and disease progression. Senescent melanoma and stromal cells secrete a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that alters immune cell recruitment and function, while immunosenescence leads to diminished cytotoxic responses and the accumulation of dysfunctional or suppressive immune subsets. Aim This review explores the interplay between cellular senescence and immunosenescence in melanoma, highlighting their contributions to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance, and discusses potential strategies to therapeutically target senescence‐related pathways. Methods A systematic review of studies published between 2000 and 2024 was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Literature included mechanistic investigations of senescence in melanoma, analyses of immunosenescence in cancer patients, and preclinical or translational studies targeting senescence‐related pathways. Results and Conclusions Senescent tumor and stromal cells drive a pro‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive TME through SASP, while aging immune cells exhibit impaired antigen presentation, reduced cytotoxicity, and increased suppressive subsets. These dual processes form a self‐reinforcing cycle of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, ultimately undermining the efficacy of ICIs. Targeting senescence, through senolytics, senostatics, or SASP modulators, has shown promise in preclinical models and may restore immune competence in melanoma. However, clinical translation requires further investigation to validate safety and efficacy. Addressing both cellular and immune senescence represents a novel and promising direction to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve melanoma outcomes."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Immunotherapy (IO) has emerged as a promising treatment option shown to improve outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of its efficacy within the older patient population. In this systematic review, we examined randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the response to IO in older patients with TNBC. Methods: We searched Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Central (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The searches combined terms reflecting (1) the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab, durvalumab, and pembrolizumab; (2) breast cancer; and (3) RCTs. Results were limited to publications in English from 2013 to September 2023. Only articles that reported efficacy were included. Risk assessment was performed and overall risk of bias was graded. Two independent reviewers rated each study based on graded scales, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: Our systematic review identified 18 full-text papers on 11 unique RCTs. Only four RCTs presented results for patients 65 and older: KEYNOTE 355, KEYNOTE 522, IMPASSION 130, and IMPASSION 131. Of the first three RCTs, a total of 530 patients out of 2923 patients (18.1%) were 65 and older. The overall risk of bias was rated low or intermediate in all 11 RCTs. In the early-stage TNBC setting, 131 of 1174 patients (11.2%) were 65 and older in KEYNOTE 522. The reported primary endpoint pathological complete response (pCR) was significantly improved in patients in the overall intention to treat (ITT) population in the first interim analysis (IO arm n = 401 patients; control arm n = 201 patients) who received pembrolizumab versus placebo (estimated treatment difference 13.6%, 95% CI 5.4 – 21.8%, p<0.001). Of the 602 total patients, 71 patients (11.8%) were 65 and older (IO arm n = 46; control arm n = 25), the treatment difference was 22.3% (95% CI -2.1 – 43.5%, p=N/A). At the fourth interim analysis (IO arm = 784 patients; control arm = 390), the co-primary endpoint event-free survival (EFS) in ITT was 84.5% at 36 months follow up, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95% CI 0.48 – 0.82, p<0.001). In patients 65 and older, the HR was 0.79 but not statistically significant (95% CI 0.40 – 1.56, p=N/A). In IMPASSION 031, atezolizumab in the early-stage setting was shown to have a significant improvement in the primary endpoint pCR in the ITT population (IO arm n = 165; control arm n = 168; rate difference of 17%, 95% CI 6–27%, one-sided p=0.0044). In the metastatic setting, KEYNOTE 355 showed that for a total of 323 patients with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 10, median OS was 23.0 months in the IO arm compared to 16.1 months in the control arm (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 – 0.95; p=0.0185) at median 44.1 months follow-up. In patients 65 and older with CPS ≥10 (n = 66), median OS was 28.3 months in the IO arm (n= 42) and 12.6 months in the control arm (n= 24) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 – 0.92, p=N/A). In the metastatic setting, atezolizumab has not been shown to significantly improve OS in the ITT overall population or age-specific groups <65 or ≥65 in the final analysis of IMPASSION130. Conclusion: There is a significant gap in data from RCTs evaluating the efficacy of IO in older patients with TNBC. The only FDA-approved IO in TNBC, pembrolizumab, was shown in the early-stage setting to improve pCR and EFS in older patients but was not statistically significant. In the metastatic setting, pembrolizumab significantly improved OS in older patients with CPS ≥10. Both studies had a limited number of patients 65 and older. No other studies reported statistically significant outcomes in patients ≥65. These results underscore the need for further research in older patients.\n Citation Format: Marie Liu, Carrie Sha, Diana Lake, Jasmeet Singh, Mark Robson, W. Iris Zhi.

    "abstract" : "TPS2700 Background: Though immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, when used as monotherapy in the advanced setting, only 18-25% of patients respond to ICI. Notably, ICI frequently lacks anti-tumor activity in immune-cold cancers where T cell priming is missing. Recent breakthroughs in identifying personal neoantigens via a comprehensive analysis of cancer sequencing data have brought increased attention to neoantigen cancer vaccines. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have shown early promise. While neoantigens have recently been investigated in some cancer types, the current neoantigen prediction algorithms have often focused on the MHC class-I subtype, single nucleotide mutations (SNM), small insertions and deletions (INDEL). We recently developed an informatics workflow, REAL-neo, for the identification, quality control (QC), and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound neoantigens that arise from somatic SNM, INDEL, aberrant RNA splicing, and gene fusions, generating much more potent neoantigen candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrated robust T-cell response and prolonged survival by combining ICI and cancer vaccines in preclinical models. This single-arm phase I clinical trial is in progress to assess the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of personalized neoantigen vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid cancers. Methods: The vaccine consists of up to 20 peptides (15-30 mer) comprising patient-specific neoantigens identified from tumor DNA and mRNA sequencing data using REAL-neo and delivered with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. The first cohort of three patients will be treated at dose level 1 consisting of 4 or 5 peptides at 300 mcg/peptide and GM-CSF 125 mcg per injection site in each of four limbs. After Cohort 1 is deemed safe, the study will expand to cohort 2, when patients will be enrolled at the same dose level for vaccine plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. Neoantigen vaccine will be given via subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 21 (cohorts 1 and 2) and weeks 5 and 8 (booster dose for cohort 2 only). Cohort 1 has been completed without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Enrollment in Cohort 2 began in January 2024. AEs are assessed according to CTCAE v5. and safety findings are reviewed by data safety medical board (DSMB). Key eligibility criteria include 1) histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies and 2) cancer progression after at least one line of the standard-of-care (SOC) systemic treatment. For cohort 2, patients must be eligible to receive pembrolizumab per SOC or the treating physician’s judgment. Clinical trial information: NCT05269381 ."

Patient characteristics were listed as follows : median age 63 (31-79), male 76 (79.2%) , heavy smoker 59 (61.5%), liver metastasis 40 (41.7%), brain metastasis 33 (34.4%) and refractory recurrence 58 (60.4%). Second-line treatments included immunotherapy crossover and combination with chemotherapy (n=40), anlotinib with or without chemotherapy (n=5), chemotherapy alone (n=4). ORR of the whole group in the second-line setting was 22.4%. Median PFS was 3.23 months (95% CI 1.96-4.50). Cross-line immunotherapy failed to improved survival for relapsed ES-SCLC compared with those without ICIs ( mPFS 3.23 vs 3.13m, p=0.829). Anlotinib based treatment showed numerically superior PFS for relapsed SCLC compared with those without anlotinib therapy (mPFS 6.00 vs 3.13m, p=0.089).\n Conclusion: This retrospective study indicated cross-line ICIs failure to improve clinical outcome for relapsed ES-SCLC, and implied the potential benefits of anlotinib in second-line setting.\n Citation Format: Rui Wan, Linjie Fan, Jia Zhong, Jianchun Duan, Zhijie Wang, Xuezhi Hao, Jie Wang.

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–90% of all lung cancers. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an expanding targeted therapy option for the treatment of NSCLC. The aim is to perform a systematic literature review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of ADCs currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, ClinicalTrial.gov and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Only randomized and non-randomized phase II-IV clinical trials focusing on ADC-based therapies for adult patients affected by NSCLC were selected. The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) were used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in the included randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively. While GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Efficacy endpoints were categorized based on primary outcomes while safety was assessed through the frequency and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), and a qualitative summary of the findings was conducted. Results: A total of seven studies, including three randomized, three non-randomized, and one without specific allocation, were included, comprising 1287 patients, with 693 (54%) men, and an average age of 63 years old. Two studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias, while six had a moderate risk or some concerns. Five ADCs were evaluated: trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), telisotuzumab vedotin, patritumab deruxtecan, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). T-DXd demonstrated superior efficacy in HER2-overexpressing and HER2-mutant NSCLC, with an ORR of 52.9% and 49.0%, respectively. However, HER2-mutant patients exhibited a longer median DOR (16.8 vs. 6.2 months) but a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (38.6% vs. 22%). T-DM1 showed modest efficacy, with an ORR of 20% in HER2-overexpressing NSCLC and 6.7% in HER2-mutant patients. Dato-DXd demonstrated improved ORR (26.4% vs. 12.8%) and PFS (4.4 vs. 3.7 months) compared to docetaxel. Patritumab deruxtecan achieved an ORR of 39% in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while telisotuzumab vedotin exhibited limited activity in c-MET-positive NSCLC (ORR 9%, median DOR 7.5 months). Frequency and severity of TEAEs varied across ADCs, with ILD being a major concern, highlighting the need for strict patient monitoring and early intervention to mitigate severe adverse events. Conclusions: ADCs represent a promising advancement in NSCLC treatment, offering targeted therapeutic options beyond conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. T-DXd has emerged as the most effective ADC for HER2-mutant NSCLC with manageable safety profile, whereas Dato-DXd provides a viable alternative for TROP2-expressing tumors. While ADCs offer significant clinical benefits, careful patient selection and proactive management of adverse events remain crucial. Ongoing and future trials will further refine the role of ADCs in personalized NSCLC treatment, potentially expanding their tumor-agnostic use to broader patient populations."

    "abstract" : "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and metabolically distinct subtype of breast cancer characterized by immune evasion, a high reliance on glycolysis, and poor treatment outcomes. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, there is an urgent need for novel, targeted approaches that integrate immune stimulation with metabolic disruption. This review explores the potential of intratumoral Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) therapy as a dual-action strategy in TNBC, focusing on its ability to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors when simultaneously targeting TNBC’s metabolic vulnerabilities. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying 60 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The selection criteria focused on BCG’s role in oncology, its immunological and metabolic effects, and its application in solid tumors. Studies were assessed for methodological rigor using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles checklist. BCG enhances antitumor immunity by engaging Toll-like receptors, triggering proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-12), and promoting the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. This immune activation reprograms the tumor microenvironment, increasing susceptibility to immunotherapy. Simultaneously, BCG disrupts TNBC’s glycolytic dependence by downregulating hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, forcing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, BCG-induced “trained immunity” epigenetically reprograms innate immune cells, enhancing long-term tumor surveillance and reducing recurrence risk. Intratumoral BCG presents a promising immunometabolic intervention for TNBC by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and disrupting tumor metabolism. Future studies should focus on optimizing its clinical application, developing sustained-release formulations, and exploring synergistic combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and metabolic inhibitors. By addressing TNBC’s dual vulnerabilities, this strategy may redefine treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract" : "Abstract Whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or perioperative chemotherapy is superior for localized esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers has been a topic of long-standing debate. For years, standard of care in the United States for localized esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been physician’s choice between the 2 strategies. More recently, adjuvant immunotherapy has also been introduced into the treatment approach for those who received neoadjuvant CRT. While preoperative radiation remains an important option for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, the ESOPEC trial presented in 2024 suggested that perioperative chemotherapy is superior to preoperative CRT in EAC. In addition, the results of the TOPGEAR trial presented in 2024 showed that adding CRT to perioperative chemotherapy did not lead to improved outcomes. This has led to a shift in practice among oncologists. However, there are various complexities and factors to consider when interpreting these studies. In this review, we outline both trials and what their findings may mean for the future of preoperative CRT in EAC. Ultimately, until more data are available that incorporate novel agents such as immunotherapy, these studies indicate that we should defer the routine inclusion of radiation in preoperative treatment for EAC."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Pembrolizumab is a novel immunotherapy agent that improves oncological outcomes in various cancer types. Although there are minor immune-related adverse events (irAEs) when used alone, various irAEs have been reported when it is combined with chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to investigate irAEs that occurred after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with pembrolizumab based on the KEYNOTE-522 regimen for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to identify fatal irAEs that should be corrected before surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Between 2022 and 2024, a total of, 71 cases from 81 patients who completed NAC with pembrolizumab based on KEYNOTE-522 regimen (wP/Cab and pembrolizumab followed by AC and pembrolizumab) followed by surgery were reviewed based on their medical records. All irAEs that occurred were investigated and classified into five categories: systemic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and endocrine. Underlying diseases that existed before the diagnosis of breast cancer or complications that occurred after surgery were excluded. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.62 (SD, ±10.6) years, and the stages at diagnosis were as follows: IIA (n=23, 32.4%), IIB (n=22, 31.0%), IIIA (n=14, 16.2%), IIIB (n=1, 1.4%), and IIIC (n=11, 15.5%). After NAC with pembrolizumab, the pCR rate was 49.3% (35/71) Fifty-three patients (62.2%) experienced adverse events, and the number of adverse events were as follows: 1 (n=11, 20.8%), 2 (n=20, 37.7%), and ≥3 (n=22, 41.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common (n=46, 86.8%), and dermatologic symptoms were the second most common (n=31, 58.5%). Among fatal irAEs, including colitis and pneumonitis, they occurred in 11 patients (20.8%) and 2 patients (3.8%), respectively. There was no case of hepatitis, myocarditis, or hypophysitis as fatal irAEs after NAC and pembrolizumab for TNBC. Among these irAEs, thyroid disorders (n=16, 22.5%) were the most common adverse event after skin rash and nausea. Of the patients with thyroid disorders, 3 experienced fatal dysfunction. Their surgeries were delayed for an average of 8.5 weeks to correct the thyroid imbalance before they could safely undergo general anesthesia. The remaining patients, who did not experience such complications, were able to undergo surgery after an average of 5.2 weeks. Conclusion: The irAEs that occurred after NAC with pembrolizumab in TNBC were varied and included some that were severe enough to affect the timing of surgery under general anesthesia. Thyroid dysfunction, in particular, should be evaluated and corrected during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy to prevent delays in surgery.\n Citation Format: Byeongju Kang, Jung Eun Choi, Moohyun Lee, Ho Yong Park, Jin Hyang Jung, Soo Jung Lee, Su Hwan Kang, Jin Gu Kang, Sun Hee Kang, Jihyoung Cho, Yee Soo Chae, Soo Jung Lee, In-Hee Lee, Keon Uk Park, Hyera Kim, Jeeyeon Lee.

    "abstract" : "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Currently, programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have become the first choice for breast cancer immunotherapies. Despite paclitaxel being considered a cornerstone drug in breast cancer treatment, the effectiveness, safety, and optimal drug selection for its combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors remain uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, performing a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database through May 18, 2024. Selected trials were those that assessed the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for the treatment of TNBC. The primary endpoint assessed was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), overall response rate (ORR), and Pathological complete response (pCR). This study is registered in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023429651. Results: A total of 8 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria were included, involving 4626 patients who received either Paclitaxel (Paclitaxel-placebo/chemotherapy) or a combination of durvalumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, toripalimab with paclitaxel. The pooled results demonstrated that Durvalumab combined with Paclitaxel significantly reduced the hazard ratio for OS (surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA]: 91.05%) and PFS compared with Paclitaxel alone (SUCRA: 83.52%). Additionally, Durvalumab plus Paclitaxel significantly improved the ORR compared with Paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10–5.20). For safety outcomes, Atezolizumab plus Paclitaxel showed a favorable profile in AEs, with no significant differences observed between groups. In the pCR study, Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel was the most effective treatment option (SUCRA: 81.85%). Conclusions: When combined with paclitaxel, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibit a favorable survival benefit. The combination of Durvalumab and paclitaxel represents the optimal treatment option. In the future, attention should be paid to the TNBC subtypes and drug dosage, as these factors may help to design personalized TNBC treatment programs."

    "abstract" : "RATIONALE\nPreserving health-related quality of life is an aspect of care that requires constant attention from the time of cancer diagnosis. Melatonin has been used to diminish treatment-related side effects and cancer symptoms, and as a medication to regulate circadian rhythm. An up-to-date systematic review is needed to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nTo identify studies for inclusion in this review, we used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and four trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 10 September 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer of any stage that evaluated melatonin (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment) versus no treatment or placebo (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment), or standard anticancer treatment. Standard anticancer treatment refers to treatments to stop or prevent cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and sleep quality within three months, and melatonin-related adverse events. Other outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, tumour response, and anticancer treatment-related harms.\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies included in the review.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If this was not possible, due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results in a narrative format. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe identified 30 RCTs (reported in 49 publications) involving 5093 adult participants with cancer (2470 males, 2228 females, 395 not reported). Studies were conducted in a hospital setting and took place in at least 10 countries. We assessed two studies at low risk of bias and the other 28 at high risk of bias.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nMelatonin plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life score (MD 2.60, 95% CI -14.53 to 19.73; 1 study, 126 participants; very low certainty evidence), and sleep score (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.42; 1 study, 50 participants; very low certainty evidence) within three months. We are also very uncertain about potential adverse effects of melatonin: headache (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 23.14; 1 study, 25 participants; very low certainty evidence); fatigue (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 2 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty evidence); and nausea (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.56; 1 study, 146 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of high risk of bias, small sample size, the width of the 95% confidence interval, and indirectness due to inadequate reporting of cancer type. Melatonin plus standard treatment versus standard treatment No data are available relating to quality of life and sleep within three months. The evidence is very uncertain about headaches (experienced by 15 of 820 participants in melatonin groups, with no data available for control groups; 2 studies, 1640 participants; very low certainty evidence). Melatonin likely reduces the incidence of fatigue (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.55; 10 studies, 1359 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00; 6 studies, 710 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Melatonin (topical use) plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life (one study reported no difference between groups, both having the same median score of 66.7; 48 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to sleep and adverse events (including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias, small sample size, and insufficient data.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe available evidence is of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving treatment for cancer. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Data were lacking for some outcomes, such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. Since the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited due to insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, the decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment cannot easily be made at the current time.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by AG Biologische Krebstherapie, Deutsche Krebshilfe (grant numbers 70-301 and 109863). The funding agency had no role in the design or conduct of the study.\n\n\nREGISTRATION\nThe protocol for this review is available via DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD010145."

    "abstract" : "Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very common type of head and neck cancer, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 50%. Inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway have gained widespread clinical adoption. However, the relationship between the infiltration characteristics of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effect of immunotherapy on HNSCC remains to be explored. Methods Patients diagnosed with HNSCC who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy were reviewed between February 2021 and March 30, 2024, in our single center. The laryngoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathologic response were evaluated to the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Result Our analysis involved 42 patients who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients underwent surgical treatment following the completion of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Among them, 6 patients achieved pCR (33%). The 1-year OS rate of the 42 patients enrolled in the study was 95.05%, and the 1-year PFS rate was 89.86%. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphocyte density in HNSCC prior to the administration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy efficacy. Compared with pretreatment, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly decreased, and the lymphocyte density was significantly increased in HNSCC patients after immunotherapy. Conclusions The integration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective strategy, can improve the tumor response rate and survival rate, and is a valuable treatment for patients with HNSCC. Furthermore, the study suggests that an elevated NLR within the HNSCC tumor microenvironment could potentially serve as a biomarker indicative of diminished immunotherapy efficacy.

Our outcomes of interest were Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of response (DOR), and treatment-related adverse Events.\n Results:\n A total of 6 RCTs involving 2107 patients were included for analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that Group 1 significantly improved PFS, OS, and DOR with HRs of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.71-1.99; p <0.00001, I² = 0%), 2.01 (95% CI: 1.75-2.29; p <0.00001, I² = 0%) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.52-3.03; p <0.0001, I² = 39%), respectively. Group 1 has better DCR and ORR compared to Group 2 with RRs of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12-2.07; p= 0.007, I² = 97%) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.20-1.86; p= 0.0003, I² = 83%), respectively. The high heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis of DCR (I² = 97%) and ORR (I² = 83%) likely reflects variability in study populations, treatment protocols, and response assessment criteria across the included RCTs. Subgroup or sensitivity analyses could help identify contributing factors. Despite the heterogeneity, the pooled effect sizes indicate a statistically significant improvement in DCR and ORR with Tislelizumab, with caution warranted when generalizing these findings. Group 1 significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared to Group 2 (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.95; p = 0.0003), with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%). No significant differences were found in adverse events, except for ALT elevations. (RR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14–1.61; p = 0.0006, I² = 25%).\n Conclusions:\n Tislelizumab, with or without chemotherapy, demonstrates greater PFS and OS benefits compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with lung cancer. There was a significantly reduced all-cause mortality in the intervention group; however, the observed increase in the risk of ALT elevation underscores the need for vigilant liver function monitoring. When combined with chemotherapy, Tislelizumab presents a promising treatment option for lung cancer.\n"

Here we report the results of primary analysis. Methods: WU-KONG1 Part B is a phase 2, multinational pivotal study to assess the antitumor efficacy of sunvozertinib at two dose levels, 200 mg and 300 mg, in platinum pre-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon20ins. Eligible patients were randomized at the ratio of 1:1 to receive 200 mg or 300 mg sunvozertinib once daily until discontinuation criteria were met. Randomization was stratified by brain metastasis at baseline and number of regimens of prior systemic anti-cancer therapy. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) (per RECIST v1.1) and key secondary endpoint included IRC assessed duration of response (DoR). Results: As of January 4, 2024, a total of 184 patients were randomized to receive sunvozertinib treatment at 200 mg or 300 mg. Patients who met the predefined criteria for efficacy analysis were included in the primary analysis. The majority of patients (96.0%) had metastatic diseases, 60.7% had ECOG PS of 1, and 23.7% had baseline brain metastasis. All patients received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and 43.4% and 13.3% had prior onco-immunotherapy or amivantamab treatment. Per IRC assessment, the best ORR was 54.3% (41.0% confirmed and 5.8% pending confirmation). Confirmed complete response (CR) was achieved in 2.9% patients. The disease control rate (including CR, PR and stable disease) was 90.8%. The primary endpoint met its predefined target, with statistical significance. Tumor response was observed in patients with baseline brain metastasis, different demographics and EGFR exon20ins subtypes. With median follow-up time of 5.5 months for responders, the duration of response has not been reached, with 74.6% responders still responding. The PFS data are not mature with approximately 6-month follow-up. Safety findings were similar to previously reported results of sunvozertinib in other clinical studies. The most common drug-related TEAEs included diarrhea, skin rash and CPK increase. The majority of the TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and clinically manageable. Conclusions: In this primary analysis of WU-KONG1 multinational pivotal study, sunvozertinib demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in platinum pre-treated NSCLC with EGFR exon20ins, with a tolerable safety profile. The updated data will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT03974022 ."

The development of increasingly potent cancer treatments has helped to improve cancer survival, but at the potential cost of cardiovascular toxicity. These cardiovascular complications can occur during or after cancer treatment, in short, medium or long term. This study aims to provide an overview of the clinical activity of the first nurse-led cardio-oncology clinic in the United Kingdom.\n \n \n \n This is a single centre, retrospective, observational cohort study reviewing our cardio-oncology clinic activity from 2023 to 2024. Patients receiving cancer treatment were included if they were referred to the nurse-led clinic for treatment and management of their cardiovascular condition before, during or after treatment.\n \n \n \n 534 patients were seen in the nurse-led Cardio-Oncology clinic, 102 of these patients were new referrals who were then followed up throughout the year from 2023-2024. The mean age of the patients was 65+14 years old and 46 (45%) were male. Amongst the new referrals, haematological and breast malignancies were most common (27.4% and 30.3% respectively), followed by lung and sarcoma malignancies (both 7.8%). Eighteen (17.6%) were treated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies, 23.5% of patient received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Seven (6.8%) received immunotherapy, 10 (9.8%) received radiotherapy, 8 patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 (2.9%) received taxane, 5 (5.8%) were treated with 5FU and 1 (0.9%) CDKi inhibitor. Six (5.8%) patients had surgery and two (1.9%) underwent stem cell transplants. Six (5.8%) patients had combination therapy and 8 (7.8%) had other disease-specific treatments.\n Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) was most common cardiovascular complication in 33 (32.3%) of patients referred, then 14 cases of (13.7%) HF with preserved EF, arrhythmia in 12 (11.7%), 10 (9.8%) presented with chest pain, 15 (14.7%) treated for hypertension and 9 (8.8%) referred prior to chemotherapy.\n More than half of the HF referrals (30.3%) resulted from cancer treatment-related heart dysfunction.\n Sixty-two (60.7%) patients referred were only having nurse-led follow-up in the Cardio-Oncology clinic and were no longer being seen in the doctor’s clinic. Forty-two (41.1%) continued cardiotoxic cancer treatment with monitoring in nurse-led clinic and 12 (11.7%) patients died due to cancer disease progression.\n \n \n \n The Cardio-Oncology nurse-led clinic encompasses holistic patient care and permits rapid up-titration of medications to optimal target dosages, resulting in treatment of cardiovascular conditions thus significant improvements in cardiac function, education, and support of side effect management. This allows uninterrupted continuation of cancer treatment, with the potential to translate into better long-term cancer and cardiovascular outcomes.  Figure 1table continued\n"

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (mTLS) predict improved outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, a significant proportion of patients with TLS-positive tumors do not respond to ICI when used as a single agent and may therefore benefit from combination therapy. The multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, deplete regulatory T cells, an immune population associated with resistance to ICI in TLS-positive tumors. We report the results of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab combined with regorafenib in patients with mTLS-positive advanced solid tumors.\n Methods: ‘Regomune’ is an open-label, multicenter phase II study assessing the combination of avelumab (10mg/kg IV every 14 days) with regorafenib (160 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle) in patients with advanced mTLS-positive solid tumors. The mTLS status was centrally assessed as previously described (Vanhersecke et al Nature Cancer 2021). All patients had confirmed progressive disease at inclusion, based on a central review of imaging. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 6-month non-progression rate using RECIST v1.1 based on blinded central review. 29 assessable patients were deemed necessary, and to meet the primary endpoint, at least 8 patients needed to be progression-free at 6 months.\n Results: Between January 2021 and July 2022, 132 patients (5 centers) underwent mTLS screening. Of these, 55 (41.7%) were identified as mTLS+, and 38 were included in the study. The top five histological subtypes were MSS colorectal cancer (15.8%), sarcoma (13.1%), oesogastric (10.5%), biliary tract (7.9%), and pancreatic cancer (7.9%). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (23.7%), maculo-papular rash (18.4%), fatigue, and oral mucositis (7.9% each). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Of the 34 patients assessed for efficacy, 16 (47%) showed tumor shrinkage, with 9 achieving a partial response (26.7%) and 7 having stable disease (20.6%). The median duration of response was 6 months. Twelve patients (comprising various tumor types including MSS colorectal cancer, small bowel carcinomas, biliary tract cancer, sarcomas, thyroid and gynecological tumors.) were progression-free at 6 months, marking the study’s primary endpoint achievement. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.6 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of tumor tissues, and comprehensive plasma proteomics analysis have collectively uncovered critical biomarkers that significantly determine both sensitivity and resistance to treatment.\n Conclusions: This is the first histology-agnostic clinical trial employing mTLS as a biomarker for patient selection for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen. Durable responses were recorded, even in cases typically resistant to immunotherapy, confirming the predictive value of mTLS.\n Trial Registration NCT03475953\n Citation Format: Antoine Italiano, Sophie Cousin, Carine Bellera, Jean-Philippe Guegan, Jean-Philippe Metges, Antoine Adenis, Rastilav Bahleda, Philippe Cassier, Coralie Cantarel, Michele Kind, Jean Palussiere, Lucile Vanhersecke, Alban Bessede.

Долгое время адъювантная химиотерапия оставалась единственной лекарственной опцией адъювантного лечения пациентов с немелкоклеточным раком лёгкого (НМРЛ) IB–IIIA стадий. Необходимость открытия новых подходов в адъювантном лечении НМРЛ, безусловно, связана с невысокими результатами общей выживаемости и с высоким риском рецидива рака лёгкого после проведения исключительно химиотерапии. В ходе эволюции знаний о биологии опухоли, о молекулярных механизмах развития и распространения рака появилось два новых направления адъювантной терапии – таргетная и иммунотерапия. В этом обзоре рассматриваются исследования III фазы, результаты которых продемонстрировали улучшение показателей выживаемости у пациентов, получивших инновационную адъювантную терапию, что позволило внедрить новые опции адъювантной терапии НМРЛ в клиническую практику.

For a long time, adjuvant chemotherapy remained the only drug option for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IB–IIIA. The necessity to discover new approaches to the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC is certainly associated with low overall survival results and a high risk of lung cancer relapse after chemotherapy alone. In the course of the evolution of knowledge about tumor biology, molecular mechanisms of cancer development and spread, two new areas of adjuvant therapy have emerged - targeted and immunotherapy. This review discusses phase III studies, the results of which demonstrated improved survival rates in patients who received innovative adjuvant therapy, which made it possible to introduce new options for adjuvant therapy for NSCLC into clinical practice. The timeframes for the implementation of these options in practical recommendations are also reflected."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with global impact, especially in the context of the rising epidemic of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape for HCC is evolving and has changed significantly in the last few years with new treatment options for patients, while the multidisciplinary team model of care remains critical. This review aims to summarize the various treatment options for patients at all stages of HCC, highlighting the growing array of systemic therapies with multi-modal options, including the potential of combining locoregional therapies with immunotherapy across different stages of the disease. With the increasing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, the future paradigm of HCC care includes the incorporation of non-hospice palliative care in the multidisciplinary team care model to improve patient quality of care, quality of life, and overall outcomes. Abstract Liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes up the majority of liver cancer cases. Despite the stabilization of incidence rates in recent years due to effective viral hepatitis treatments, as well as improved outcomes from early detection and treatment advances, the burden of HCC is anticipated to rise again due to increasing rates of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape is evolving and requires a multidisciplinary approach, often involving multi-modal treatments that include surgical resection, transplantation, local regional therapies, and systemic treatments. The optimal approach to the care of the HCC patient requires a multidisciplinary team involving hepatology, medical oncology, diagnostic and interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and surgery. In order to determine which approach is best, an individualized treatment plan should consider the patient’s liver function, functional status, comorbidities, cancer stage, and preferences. In this review, we provide an overview of the current treatment options and key trials that have revolutionized the management of HCC. We also discuss evolving treatment paradigms for the future."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, requiring new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This research arises from the need to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The authors aim to systematically evaluate the potential of emerging biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNAs and mutational load of blood tumors and their relationship with different treatments. The findings of this study could have a significant impact on the research community by providing a basis for integrating these biomarkers into clinical practice, thereby improving personalized treatment strategies and patient outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. Abstract Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, often diagnosed at advanced stages, which diminishes the effective treatment options and survival rates. This systematic review assesses the utility of emerging biomarkers—circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB)—enhanced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the diagnostic accuracy, prognostic evaluation, and treatment strategies in NSCLC. Analyzing data from 37 studies involving 10,332 patients from 2020 to 2024, the review highlights how biomarkers like ctDNA and PD-L1 expression critically inform the selection of personalized therapies, particularly beneficial in the advanced stages of NSCLC. These biomarkers are critical for prognostic assessments and in dynamically adapting treatment plans, where high PD-L1 expression and specific genetic mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, EGFR mutations) significantly guide the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The findings recommend integrating these biomarkers into standardized clinical pathways to maximize their potential in enhancing the treatment precision, ultimately fostering significant advancements in oncology and improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review substantiates the prognostic and predictive value of these biomarkers and emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation in biomarker research."

This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and the first network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs (or combined new drugs) for the treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive/HER2-Negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with CDK4/6i. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched from 2000 to 2024 and conference proceedings from major congresses of the last two years were retrieved. Two authors independently performed the screening, three authors extracted data, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) as secondary endpoints. The new drugs (or combined new drugs) were compared to either standard chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy alone (ET) in second-line and beyond treatment settings. Network meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, calculating risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and chi-square test. Results: A total of 4034 papers were identified, after removing duplicates. Out of the 67 studies screened in full-text, 26 clinical trials were selected, encompassing a total of 7083 patients and five different drug classes. Specifically, 9 studies included biological agnostic therapy (CDK4/6i, mTOR inhibitors, immunotherapy), 7 novel ET (including selective estrogen receptor degraders – oral SERD), 5 targeted therapies (PI3K, AKT and PARP inhibitors), 3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs: trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd] and sacituzumab govitecan), and 2 CT (eribulin, VEX metronomic). Control arms consisted of either ET alone (mainly fulvestrant) or standard CT (paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All network estimates coincided with pairwise estimates as no direct comparison between the new drugs existed in the literature. Among all therapies, T-DXd showed the largest PFS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.51 (CI: 0.45 – 0.57)], followed by ribociclib plus ET compared to ET alone [HR 0.57 (CI: 0.45 – 0.72)]. Interaction tests conducted among the five drug classes showed a significant different positive effect on PFS by targeted therapies [HR 0.61 (CI: 0.57 – 0.66)] compared to ET alone (p-value 0.009) but failed to identify significant differences in PFS among the different drug classes compared to CT (p-value 0.16), although ADCs showed a larger effect in PFS [HR 0.63 (CI: 0.50 – 0.80)]. Although ADCs showed the largest OS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.72 (CI: 0.58 – 0.89)], the interaction test among the drug classes was not significant (p-value 0.10), and similarly no interaction was observed for ORR. Conversely, the interaction test for toxicity indicates a significant difference between the five drug classes compared to ET, with biological agnostic therapy showing greater toxicity [HR 4.81 (CI: 3.18 – 7.25)] compared to other treatment options. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis showed that targeted therapies, such as PI3K, AKT, and PARP inhibitors, demonstrate significant improvement in PFS compared to ET with a positive interaction test among the different drug classes. Biological agnostic therapies offer some survival improvement but at the cost of increased toxicity as compared to other options. These findings could help tailor the most suitable treatment for each patient, determining the optimal sequence following progression to CDK4/6i for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC.\n Citation Format: Mariangela Gaudio, Michela Cinquini, Flavia Jacobs, Cristina Mazzi, Valter Torri, Antonino Carmelo Tralongo, Chiara Benvenuti, Riccardo Gerosa, Jacopo Canzian, Giuseppe Saltalamacchia, Rita de Sanctis, Armando Santoro, Alberto Zambelli.

    "abstract" : "\n Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 amplification. This unique molecular profile limits treatment options, as TNBC does not respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies, making chemotherapy the cornerstone of systemic treatment. Achieving a complete pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved long-term outcomes and survival rates in TNBC patients. However, pCR rates can vary significantly depending on the chemotherapy regimen used, as well as the inclusion of other modalities such as immunotherapy. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted at Chihuahua's State Cancer Center, where medical records of patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with TNBC between January 2012 and June 2023 were reviewed to evaluate pCR after neoadjuvant treatment. The study compared the effectiveness of three chemotherapy regimens: anthracyclines and taxanes (AC-T), anthracyclines combined with taxanes and carboplatin (AC-Tcarboplatin), and any chemotherapy regimen paired with immunotherapy (IT). Fisher's exact tests were used to compare pCR rates across these groups, with p-values calculated to determine clinical significance and identify the most effective treatment strategies. In total, 1279 breast cancer patients were included, with 182 (14.23%) diagnosed with TNBC. Among these, 92 (50.55%) received neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in 35 (19.23%) achieving pCR. Upon observing the pCR rates among different regimens, we found clinical relevance in the variations. Statistically significant differences were confirmed when comparing neoadjuvant treatments in relation to pCR rates (p=0.029). Sixty patients received the AC-T regimen, achieving a pCR rate of 26.67%. Thirteen patients received AC-Tcarboplatin, with a pCR rate of 46.15%. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, showing a high pCR rate of 92.31%. Finally, 6 patients received other chemotherapy regimens without immunotherapy or carboplatin, with only 1 (16.67%) achieving pCR.This analysis highlights significant differences in pCR rates depending on the administered treatment, emphasizing firstly the clear benefits of adding carboplatin to the neoadjuvant regimen. Additionally, although the number of patients treated with immunotherapy was limited, the results unequivocally indicate its benefit in significantly enhancing complete pathological responses compared to other treatment groups. While each therapeutic group demonstrated specific advantages in pCR rates, stressing the critical importance of early access to advanced therapeutic options such as immunotherapy from the time of TNBC diagnosis is crucial. Finally, it is recommended to establish better public policies to improve access to these treatments and explore the potential additional benefits of low-dose immunotherapy in future research to further optimize clinical outcomes.\n Citation Format: Enrique José Zamudio Lozoya, Luisa Fernanda González-González, Victor Baylon-Valdez, Paolo Mendoza-Muraira, Regina Martínez-García-Lascurain, Patricio Ochoa Elizondo, Rafael Martínez-Sanciprián, Beatriz De León-Jiménez, Alma Andrea Elizaldi-San Miguel, Gustavo Gil Reza Bravo, América Susana Mares García, René Lázaro González-Mendoza.

    "abstract" : "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are iron-dependent and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). All three epigenetic modifications are intermediates in DNA demethylation. TET proteins are recruited by transcription factors and by RNA polymerase II to modify 5mC at enhancers and gene bodies, thereby regulating gene expression during development, cell lineage specification, and cell activation. It is not yet clear, however, how the established biochemical activities of TET enzymes in oxidizing 5mC and mediating DNA demethylation relate to the known association of TET deficiency with inflammation, clonal hematopoiesis, and cancer. There are hints that the ability of TET deficiency to promote cell proliferation in a signal-dependent manner may be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we draw upon recent findings in cells of the immune system to illustrate established as well as emerging ideas of how TET proteins influence cellular function.

    "abstract" : "Background. Obesity and diabetes mellitus significantly increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively affect the survival of these patients. Colorectal cancer and diabetes mellitus share common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Metformin is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide. In addition to its hypoglycemic effect, metformin has anti-tumor effects, which has stimulated interest in researching metformin as a potential method of preventing CRC and slowing its progression. \nPurpose – to highlight the results of studies of the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of metformin in colorectal cancer patients. \nMaterials and methods. Data searches for the review were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Research data published in 2014–2024 were analyzed and systematized. \nResults. Epidemiologic studies of recent decades have shown that patients with T2DM taking metformin have a lower risk of colorectal adenomas and CRC developing and a better prognosis. There is some evidence of a protective role of the drug in patients without diabetes. It was found that the risk of developing CRC depends on the dose and duration of metformin use. Use of metformin is associated with improved survival of patients with both early stages of CRC and metastatic disease. However, some publications have not proven a relationship between metformin use and the risk of CRC and survival of these patients, which requires an analysis of the reasons for these discrepancies. The experience of using metformin in combination with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and immunotherapy in patients with CRC is currently limited to a small number of studies with small patient samples. A moderate improvement in antitumor efficacy was observed with the combination of metformin with 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan in patients with refractory metastatic CRC. Recent studies have shown promising antitumor activity of the combination of metformin with polychemotherapy in CRC treatment. In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with diabetes mellitus, the degree of tumor regression and reduction of lymph node lesion after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy was higher in the group receiving metformin than in the group of patients not using this drug. Similar results were obtained in patients without diabetes. The increase in antitumor activity in the combination of metformin with immune checkpoint blockers observed in preclinical studies, was not confirmed in patients with stage IV microsatellite stable CRC. \nConclusions. Observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality among people receiving metformin. The drug has also been shown to be beneficial for diabetic patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients receiving the combination treatment had better pathologic responses compared to patients who did not take the drug. At the same time, studies of the combined use of metformin with chemotherapeutic drugs are limited mainly to small single-arm trials. Randomized clinical trials with large numbers of CRC patients are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of metformin in combination with standard anticancer treatment."

    "abstract" : "Background Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert a potential clinical enhancing effect in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while antibiotics exert a detrimental impact. Prior meta-analysis papers have substantial limitations and are devoid of recent published studies. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis and, for the first time, assess whether probiotics can restore the damage of antibiotics to immunotherapy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three English databases and three Chinese databases with a cutoff date of August 11, 2024. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) or the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). Engauge Digitizer v12.1 was employed to extract hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for survival outcomes when these data were not explicitly provided in the manuscripts. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 14 software. Results The study sample comprised eight retrospective and four prospective studies, involving a total of 3,142 participants. The findings indicate that probiotics significantly prolong the overall survival (OS) (I2 = 31.2%; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.73, p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (I2 = 65.2%; HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.81, p < 0.001) in cancer patients receiving ICIs, enhance the objective response rate (ORR) (I2 = 33.5%; OR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.40, p = 0.001) and disease control rate (DCR) (I2 = 50.0%; OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.35, p = 0.002). For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exposed to antibiotics, the use of probiotics was associated with superior OS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.34-0.59, p < 0.001) and PFS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.38-0.62, p < 0.001) when compared to non-users. Subgroup differences were observed regarding the cancer type (P=0.006) and ethnic backgrounds (P=0.011) in OS. Conclusions The meta-analysis findings suggest that probiotics can effectively extend the survival of cancer treated with ICIs. In NSCLC, probiotics appear to mitigate the negative impact of antibiotics on immunotherapy effectiveness, which has profound clinical significance. Nevertheless, additional large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to further validate these findings.

Accumulating research suggests that patients with ARID gene alterations of the human switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complex are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. To investigate the correlation between ARID gene alterations/RNA expression levels and clinical outcomes after immunotherapies, we reviewed patients with solid malignancies seen at our Institute.\n \n \n \n A review of patients (from 2014 to 2024) with solid malignancies from our clinical database at the Avera Cancer Institute, whose tissue DNA and RNA were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) by Tempus and Foundation Medicine, Inc. Patients who have alterations in the ARID gene (ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2 and ARID5B) and received therapeutic regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors) alone or in combination with other treatments were assembled as Cohort 1. Patients with wild-type ARID gene and received ICIs were used as Cohort 2. The outcome differences of the patients between Cohort 1 and 2 were then assessed. Furthermore, patients in Cohort 1 were stratified to subgroups by RNA levels, microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, and the outcomes were analyzed.\n \n \n \n 1. Of the 3620 patients in our database, we found 591 (16.3%) patients harboring ARID gene alterations with one of 15 types of cancer. This includes 160 (4.4% of 3620 and 27.1% of 591 patients) patients (Cohort 1) that received ICIs (excluding 10 patients unevaluable due to treatment termination per drug toxicity or lack of follow-up information), and 470 (13.0%) patients (Cohort 2) with wild-type ARID gene received ICIs. 2. No statistical difference of RNA expression level between Cohort 1 (N= 50) and Cohort 2 (N= 135). 3. Patients in Cohort 1 (N= 160), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) measured from date of the initiation of ICIs were 8.3 and 20.3 months. 4. PFS and OS of patients in Cohort 2 appear less than in Cohort 1. Assessment for patients of Cohort 2 and subgroups is ongoing. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.\n \n \n \n Improved response rates to ICIs will require the efforts of researchers and clinicians to advance our understanding of tumor immunology, biology as well as omics and to integrate them with other important components of precision oncology.

In 2024–2025, emerging targeted therapies promise improved results with reduced adverse effects. This review is the first of an annual series exploring the latest in‐patient developments in several key areas, focusing on mechanisms. We present advances in the use and action of several therapies including epigenetic modulators, protein degraders, apoptotic inducers, gene editing, and immunotherapy. We discuss the individual molecular mechanisms and clinical findings of these developments, emphasising their potential to improve survival and offer renewed hope for individuals with blood cancer. Importantly, such novel approaches with testing in patients should lead to further intensive efforts both at basic and translational research levels aiming at effective targeted and immunotherapy in blood cancers."

Recent studies have elucidated a strong relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using single-cell multi-omics technology. In this study, we aim to develop predictive models for both objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) using TIME features with machine learning in advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line immunotherapy.\n Methods: A total of 210 patients with advanced NSCLC who received anti-PD-1/PDL-1 therapy at Shanghai Chest Hospital from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2023 were included in this study. Among them, 110 cases who received pembrolizumab were randomly split into training set and validation set with a 2:1 ratio. The remaining patients were designated as independent validation cohort. Five multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) panels were developed based on literature review and in-house dataset mining. mIHC tests were performed using baseline tumor samples. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by ORR and PFS (RECIST v1.1). ORR and PFS models were developed using machine learning methods in training set with 5-fold cross-validation and further validated in validation set and independent validation cohort.\n Results: After data cleaning, 68 cases in training set and 34 cases in validation set were further analyzed. In terms of single immune- or spatial- based biomarker, positive rate of PD1+ cells in stroma and spatial relationship of PD1+/PDL1+ cell pairs exhibited the highest correlation with ORR. In addition, positive rate of PDL1+ tumor cells and nearest distance between FOXP3+ cells and tumor cells were highly correlated with PFS. Our ORR model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in the training set and 0.82 in the validation set. When applying optimal cutoff in our PFS model to stratify patients into low- and high- risk groups, low-risk group showed prolonged PFS in both training set (p < 0.0001; HR: 0.25, 95% CI [0.13 - 0.51]) and validation set (p = 0.00046; HR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.09 - 0.55]). Moreover, our ORR model outperformed PDL1 IHC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.60; DeLong’s test p = 0.005) in these 102 patients. Independent validation of the models is still awaited.\n Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we developed and validated ORR and PFS predictive models for first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients based on mIHC technology. Our models displayed superior diagnostic performance compared to PDL1 IHC results.\n Citation Format: Chan Xiang, Jianjian Zheng, Sidong Chen, Zhanxian Shang, Shi Yang, Lianying Guo, Lei Jiao, Yang Wang, Yuchen Han.

    "abstract" : "6021 Background: Currently, the landscape of treating advanced malignancies has undergone a transformative shift with the advent of immunotherapy employing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Notably, several ICIs have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities for individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC). An emerging body of evidence implies a plausible link between body mass index (BMI) and the effectiveness of ICIs in the broader context of cancer patients. Nevertheless, the specific correlation within the subset of head and neck cancer patients undergoing immunotherapeutic interventions remains unclear and warrants meticulous investigation. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched extensively for records published until January 2024. Full-text articles aligned with the research objective were included, while records published in English, case reports, reviews, editorials, and studies reporting immunotherapy combined with other cancer therapies were excluded. The data required for review and analysis was abstracted in Excel files by two independent reviewers. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager software, and methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Only six studies were eligible for review and analysis. A subgroup analysis of data from these studies showed that obese HNC patients on immunotherapy had significantly better overall survival (OS) rates than non-obese patients (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29 – 0.93; p=0.03). However, the progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically similar between obese and non-obese patients (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 – 1.33; p=0.30). In addition, when BMI was stratified as either low or high, no significant difference was observed in the OS and PFS of HNC patients (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.59 – 1.66; p=0.97 and HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61 – 1.41; p=0.42, respectively). Similarly, the statistical analyses showed that overweight patients have similar OS and PFS as patients with normal BMI (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.15 – 1.92; p=0.33 and HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.20 – 1.52; p = 0.25, respectively). In contrast, underweight patients demonstrated poor OS and PFS (HR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.29 – 5.12; p=0.008 and HR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.17 – 6.52; p=0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Obese HNC patients on immunotherapy tend to have improved OS than non-obese patients, while underweight patients have worse clinical prognoses than those with normal or above BMI."

    "abstract" : "Intorduction. HPV infection stimulates a local immune response, because HPV positivity in cervical cancer places these tumors in a prognostically better group in terms of response to radiotherapy (RT). However, the response to RT treatment in locally advanced cervical cancer depending on the presence of a certain subtype of the HPV virus has been very little investigated in previous research. Taking into account the high incidence rate of cervical cancer in developing countries, where the disease is most often diagnosed at a locally advanced stage, the aim of this review of the available literature was to analyse predictive potential of HPV typing in terms of the response to the RT with/without chemopotentiation as a standard treatment approach. Method. A review of studies dealing with the analysis of the predictive significance of HPV typing in locally advanced cervical cancer patients treated with definitive RT with or without chemopotentiation, from 2000 to 2024, was conducted. Results. Six clinical studies were identified that met the search criteria. The most frequently analyzed subtypes were HPV 16,18,33 and 52. In five studies the HPV 16 subtype was identified in more radioresistant cervical cancers. Conclusion: there is an exceptional clinical importance of HPV typing in order to create an individual treatment strategy, especially in the era of immunotherapy given concurrently with definitive RT. It is also necessary to conduct clinical studies with a large number of patients and consider what the treatment outcomes are depending on the applied RT technique, dose and fractionation regime."

    "abstract" : "\n 465\n \n \n Background:\n Gastric cancer (GC) is associated with significant mortality due to the limited efficacy of current conventional treatments, necessitating the need for novel therapies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore the potential role and outcomes of bi-specific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy in treating GC.\n Methods:\n Using PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrial.gov for 'Gastric cancers', 'bispecific antibodies', and 'CAR-T therapy' as of March 30, 2024. Out of 35 studies, 9 were selected for pooled analysis in R (v4.3.3) using the Der Simonian-Laird Estimator, calculating inter-study variance and extracting data with 95% CI.\n Results:\n 138 gastric cancer (GC) patients from 2 phase I (22.22%), 3 phase Ib (33.33%), 3 phase II (33.33%), and 1 case report (11.11%). Median age was 57 (28-77) years, and 76% (31/41) were male. Bispecific antibodies were MCLA-128 (25/138), catumaxomab (15/138), AK104 PD-1/CTLA-4 (16/138), ABL 001 DLL4VEGFA (19/138), and KN026 (25/138) while CART therapy was CT041 (38/138). The pooled overall response (OR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR) for bispecific antibodies was 37% (95% CI, 0.12-0.71, I2=76%, n=100, p <0.01), 21% (95% CI,0.05-0.55, I2=73%, n=85, p<0.01), and 11%(95% CI, 0.02-0.38, I2=63%, n=85, p=0.03) respectively, while the pooled OR, PR, and CR for CART was 56% (95% CI, 0.40-0.71, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.41), 53%(95% CI, 0.36-0.69, I2=0%, n=38, p=0.38, ), and 12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.42, I2=38%, n=38 p=0.2), respectively. The pooled disease control rate was 75% (95%CI,0.46-0.92, I2=79%, n=80, p < 0.01) for bispecific antibodies and 27% (95% CI,0.16-0.40, I2=0%, n=65, p=0.37) had the stable disease while pooled incidence of progressive disease was 18% (95% CI,0.09-0.31, I2=0%, n=55, p=0.53). The median progressive free survival was 6.74 months, with a median overall survival of 14.75 months. Common adverse effects included anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and cytokine release syndrome grades 1 or 2.\n Conclusions:\n This analysis shows promising results in GC patients using bi-specific antibodies and CAR-T cell therapy. However, further clinical trials are needed to fully explore their potential.\n"

    "abstract" : "Endometrial cancer (EC) is now the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, \"Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era.\" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC."

    "abstract" : "Melanoma is one of the most significant and dangerous superficial skin tumors with a high fatality rate, thanks to its high invasion rate, drug resistance and frequent metastasis properties. Unfortunately, researchers for decades have demonstrated that the outcome of using conventional therapies like chemotherapy and immunotherapy with normal drug delivery routes, such as an oral route to treat melanoma was not satisfactory. The severe adverse effects, slow drug delivery efficiency and low drug accumulation at targeted malignancy sites all lead to poor anti-cancer efficacy and terrible treatment experience. As a novel transdermal drug delivery system, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as an effective solution to help improve the low cure rate of melanoma. The excellent characteristics of MNs make it easy to penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) and then locally deliver the drug towards the lesion without drug leakage to mitigate the occurrence of side effects and increase the drug accumulation. Therefore, loading chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapy drugs in MNs can address the problems mentioned above, and MNs play a crucial role in improving the curative effect of conventional treatment methods. Notably, novel tumor therapies like photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have shown good application prospects in the treatment of melanoma, and MNs provide a valid platform for the combination of conventional therapies and novel therapies by encompassing different therapeutic materials in the matrix of MNs. The synergistic effect of multiple therapies can enhance the therapeutic efficacy compared to single therapies, showing great potential in melanoma treatment. Dissolving MNs have been the most commonly used microneedles in the treatment of melanoma in recent years, mainly because of their simple fabrication procedure and enough drug loading. So, considering the increasing use of dissolving MNs, this review collects research studies published in the last four years (2020-2024) that have rarely been included in other reviews to update the progress of applications of dissolving MNs in anti-melanoma treatment, especially in synergistic therapies. This review also presents current design and fabrication methods of dissolving MNs; the limitations of microneedle technology in the treatment of melanoma are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide valuable guidance for their future development."

This review highlights 10 landmark studies from 2024 that address emerging therapies and evolving clinical standards. Immunotherapy remains a central focus, with checkpoint inhibitors redefining the management of solid tumors and showing expanded applications across disease sites and earlier stages of disease. Targeted therapies and antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab deruxtecan and enfortumab vedotin, are enhancing precision treatment options in metastatic cancer. Meanwhile, advances in supportive care, such as magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate cancer screening, ponsegromab for cachexia, and celiac plexus radiosurgery for pain, show enhanced symptom management and quality of life for patients. These innovations highlight the critical role of multidisciplinary approaches, where internal medicine physicians contribute to co-management and toxicity monitoring, ultimately optimizing patient care.

    "abstract" : "ABSTRACT Background Melanoma is one of the most immunogenic malignancies, yet resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a major obstacle to durable therapeutic success. Emerging evidence indicates that aging‐related processes, including cellular senescence and immunosenescence, can reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) to favor immune evasion and disease progression. Senescent melanoma and stromal cells secrete a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that alters immune cell recruitment and function, while immunosenescence leads to diminished cytotoxic responses and the accumulation of dysfunctional or suppressive immune subsets. Aim This review explores the interplay between cellular senescence and immunosenescence in melanoma, highlighting their contributions to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance, and discusses potential strategies to therapeutically target senescence‐related pathways. Methods A systematic review of studies published between 2000 and 2024 was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Literature included mechanistic investigations of senescence in melanoma, analyses of immunosenescence in cancer patients, and preclinical or translational studies targeting senescence‐related pathways. Results and Conclusions Senescent tumor and stromal cells drive a pro‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive TME through SASP, while aging immune cells exhibit impaired antigen presentation, reduced cytotoxicity, and increased suppressive subsets. These dual processes form a self‐reinforcing cycle of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, ultimately undermining the efficacy of ICIs. Targeting senescence, through senolytics, senostatics, or SASP modulators, has shown promise in preclinical models and may restore immune competence in melanoma. However, clinical translation requires further investigation to validate safety and efficacy. Addressing both cellular and immune senescence represents a novel and promising direction to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve melanoma outcomes."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Immunotherapy (IO) has emerged as a promising treatment option shown to improve outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, there exists a notable gap in our understanding of its efficacy within the older patient population. In this systematic review, we examined randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the response to IO in older patients with TNBC. Methods: We searched Medline ALL (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Central (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The searches combined terms reflecting (1) the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab, durvalumab, and pembrolizumab; (2) breast cancer; and (3) RCTs. Results were limited to publications in English from 2013 to September 2023. Only articles that reported efficacy were included. Risk assessment was performed and overall risk of bias was graded. Two independent reviewers rated each study based on graded scales, and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: Our systematic review identified 18 full-text papers on 11 unique RCTs. Only four RCTs presented results for patients 65 and older: KEYNOTE 355, KEYNOTE 522, IMPASSION 130, and IMPASSION 131. Of the first three RCTs, a total of 530 patients out of 2923 patients (18.1%) were 65 and older. The overall risk of bias was rated low or intermediate in all 11 RCTs. In the early-stage TNBC setting, 131 of 1174 patients (11.2%) were 65 and older in KEYNOTE 522. The reported primary endpoint pathological complete response (pCR) was significantly improved in patients in the overall intention to treat (ITT) population in the first interim analysis (IO arm n = 401 patients; control arm n = 201 patients) who received pembrolizumab versus placebo (estimated treatment difference 13.6%, 95% CI 5.4 – 21.8%, p<0.001). Of the 602 total patients, 71 patients (11.8%) were 65 and older (IO arm n = 46; control arm n = 25), the treatment difference was 22.3% (95% CI -2.1 – 43.5%, p=N/A). At the fourth interim analysis (IO arm = 784 patients; control arm = 390), the co-primary endpoint event-free survival (EFS) in ITT was 84.5% at 36 months follow up, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95% CI 0.48 – 0.82, p<0.001). In patients 65 and older, the HR was 0.79 but not statistically significant (95% CI 0.40 – 1.56, p=N/A). In IMPASSION 031, atezolizumab in the early-stage setting was shown to have a significant improvement in the primary endpoint pCR in the ITT population (IO arm n = 165; control arm n = 168; rate difference of 17%, 95% CI 6–27%, one-sided p=0.0044). In the metastatic setting, KEYNOTE 355 showed that for a total of 323 patients with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥ 10, median OS was 23.0 months in the IO arm compared to 16.1 months in the control arm (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 – 0.95; p=0.0185) at median 44.1 months follow-up. In patients 65 and older with CPS ≥10 (n = 66), median OS was 28.3 months in the IO arm (n= 42) and 12.6 months in the control arm (n= 24) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 – 0.92, p=N/A). In the metastatic setting, atezolizumab has not been shown to significantly improve OS in the ITT overall population or age-specific groups <65 or ≥65 in the final analysis of IMPASSION130. Conclusion: There is a significant gap in data from RCTs evaluating the efficacy of IO in older patients with TNBC. The only FDA-approved IO in TNBC, pembrolizumab, was shown in the early-stage setting to improve pCR and EFS in older patients but was not statistically significant. In the metastatic setting, pembrolizumab significantly improved OS in older patients with CPS ≥10. Both studies had a limited number of patients 65 and older. No other studies reported statistically significant outcomes in patients ≥65. These results underscore the need for further research in older patients.\n Citation Format: Marie Liu, Carrie Sha, Diana Lake, Jasmeet Singh, Mark Robson, W. Iris Zhi.

    "abstract" : "TPS2700 Background: Though immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, when used as monotherapy in the advanced setting, only 18-25% of patients respond to ICI. Notably, ICI frequently lacks anti-tumor activity in immune-cold cancers where T cell priming is missing. Recent breakthroughs in identifying personal neoantigens via a comprehensive analysis of cancer sequencing data have brought increased attention to neoantigen cancer vaccines. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have shown early promise. While neoantigens have recently been investigated in some cancer types, the current neoantigen prediction algorithms have often focused on the MHC class-I subtype, single nucleotide mutations (SNM), small insertions and deletions (INDEL). We recently developed an informatics workflow, REAL-neo, for the identification, quality control (QC), and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound neoantigens that arise from somatic SNM, INDEL, aberrant RNA splicing, and gene fusions, generating much more potent neoantigen candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrated robust T-cell response and prolonged survival by combining ICI and cancer vaccines in preclinical models. This single-arm phase I clinical trial is in progress to assess the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of personalized neoantigen vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid cancers. Methods: The vaccine consists of up to 20 peptides (15-30 mer) comprising patient-specific neoantigens identified from tumor DNA and mRNA sequencing data using REAL-neo and delivered with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. The first cohort of three patients will be treated at dose level 1 consisting of 4 or 5 peptides at 300 mcg/peptide and GM-CSF 125 mcg per injection site in each of four limbs. After Cohort 1 is deemed safe, the study will expand to cohort 2, when patients will be enrolled at the same dose level for vaccine plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. Neoantigen vaccine will be given via subcutaneous injection on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 21 (cohorts 1 and 2) and weeks 5 and 8 (booster dose for cohort 2 only). Cohort 1 has been completed without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Enrollment in Cohort 2 began in January 2024. AEs are assessed according to CTCAE v5. and safety findings are reviewed by data safety medical board (DSMB). Key eligibility criteria include 1) histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies and 2) cancer progression after at least one line of the standard-of-care (SOC) systemic treatment. For cohort 2, patients must be eligible to receive pembrolizumab per SOC or the treating physician’s judgment. Clinical trial information: NCT05269381 ."

Eligible studies included the study of oral microorganisms via genomic sequencing and molecular mechanisms associated with LC in saliva, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or tumor tissue from LC patients. A quality analysis of the studies was carried out using the New Castell scale (NCS), and a qualitative synthesis was performed according to the localization and sample type.\n Results:\n Of the 1,880 scrutinized articles, 50 studies comprised 29 cross-sectional, 7 case-controls, and 14 cohorts were selected. The quality analysis sheds light on potential biases.The findings unveiled a conspicuous overgrowth of specific microbial taxa in LC patients' saliva BALF samples of\n Veillonella\n and\n Streptococcus\n . However,\n Veillonella\n was associated with a better response to ICIs therapy.Conversely, samples from the\n Bacteroides\n genus, related to periodontal disease, exhibited no significant correlation with LC. Although oral microorganisms in the tumor tissue were variable, this presence was associated with poor prognosis in LC. However,\n Prevotella nigrescens\n were associated with longer PFS.\n Fusobacterium nucleatum\n had a poor response in ICs. Oral microorganisms were related to xenobiotics biodegradation, amino acid, sugar, sucrose metabolism, proinflammatory environment, and inhibiting the immune response and cell redox homeostasis.\n Conclusions:\n Overgrowth of some oral microorganisms in the saliva and BALF is associated with diagnosis, poor prognosis, and low response to immunotherapy. Further, well-designed studies should evaluate the impact of the oral microbiome on the response to ICs.\n"

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–90% of all lung cancers. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an expanding targeted therapy option for the treatment of NSCLC. The aim is to perform a systematic literature review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of ADCs currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, ClinicalTrial.gov and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Only randomized and non-randomized phase II-IV clinical trials focusing on ADC-based therapies for adult patients affected by NSCLC were selected. The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2.0) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) were used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in the included randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively. While GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Efficacy endpoints were categorized based on primary outcomes while safety was assessed through the frequency and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), and a qualitative summary of the findings was conducted. Results: A total of seven studies, including three randomized, three non-randomized, and one without specific allocation, were included, comprising 1287 patients, with 693 (54%) men, and an average age of 63 years old. Two studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias, while six had a moderate risk or some concerns. Five ADCs were evaluated: trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), telisotuzumab vedotin, patritumab deruxtecan, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). T-DXd demonstrated superior efficacy in HER2-overexpressing and HER2-mutant NSCLC, with an ORR of 52.9% and 49.0%, respectively. However, HER2-mutant patients exhibited a longer median DOR (16.8 vs. 6.2 months) but a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (38.6% vs. 22%). T-DM1 showed modest efficacy, with an ORR of 20% in HER2-overexpressing NSCLC and 6.7% in HER2-mutant patients. Dato-DXd demonstrated improved ORR (26.4% vs. 12.8%) and PFS (4.4 vs. 3.7 months) compared to docetaxel. Patritumab deruxtecan achieved an ORR of 39% in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while telisotuzumab vedotin exhibited limited activity in c-MET-positive NSCLC (ORR 9%, median DOR 7.5 months). Frequency and severity of TEAEs varied across ADCs, with ILD being a major concern, highlighting the need for strict patient monitoring and early intervention to mitigate severe adverse events. Conclusions: ADCs represent a promising advancement in NSCLC treatment, offering targeted therapeutic options beyond conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. T-DXd has emerged as the most effective ADC for HER2-mutant NSCLC with manageable safety profile, whereas Dato-DXd provides a viable alternative for TROP2-expressing tumors. While ADCs offer significant clinical benefits, careful patient selection and proactive management of adverse events remain crucial. Ongoing and future trials will further refine the role of ADCs in personalized NSCLC treatment, potentially expanding their tumor-agnostic use to broader patient populations."

    "abstract" : "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and metabolically distinct subtype of breast cancer characterized by immune evasion, a high reliance on glycolysis, and poor treatment outcomes. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, there is an urgent need for novel, targeted approaches that integrate immune stimulation with metabolic disruption. This review explores the potential of intratumoral Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) therapy as a dual-action strategy in TNBC, focusing on its ability to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors when simultaneously targeting TNBC’s metabolic vulnerabilities. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying 60 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. The selection criteria focused on BCG’s role in oncology, its immunological and metabolic effects, and its application in solid tumors. Studies were assessed for methodological rigor using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles checklist. BCG enhances antitumor immunity by engaging Toll-like receptors, triggering proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-12), and promoting the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. This immune activation reprograms the tumor microenvironment, increasing susceptibility to immunotherapy. Simultaneously, BCG disrupts TNBC’s glycolytic dependence by downregulating hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, forcing a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, BCG-induced “trained immunity” epigenetically reprograms innate immune cells, enhancing long-term tumor surveillance and reducing recurrence risk. Intratumoral BCG presents a promising immunometabolic intervention for TNBC by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and disrupting tumor metabolism. Future studies should focus on optimizing its clinical application, developing sustained-release formulations, and exploring synergistic combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and metabolic inhibitors. By addressing TNBC’s dual vulnerabilities, this strategy may redefine treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract" : "Abstract Whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or perioperative chemotherapy is superior for localized esophageal or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers has been a topic of long-standing debate. For years, standard of care in the United States for localized esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinoma (EAC) has been physician’s choice between the 2 strategies. More recently, adjuvant immunotherapy has also been introduced into the treatment approach for those who received neoadjuvant CRT. While preoperative radiation remains an important option for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, the ESOPEC trial presented in 2024 suggested that perioperative chemotherapy is superior to preoperative CRT in EAC. In addition, the results of the TOPGEAR trial presented in 2024 showed that adding CRT to perioperative chemotherapy did not lead to improved outcomes. This has led to a shift in practice among oncologists. However, there are various complexities and factors to consider when interpreting these studies. In this review, we outline both trials and what their findings may mean for the future of preoperative CRT in EAC. Ultimately, until more data are available that incorporate novel agents such as immunotherapy, these studies indicate that we should defer the routine inclusion of radiation in preoperative treatment for EAC."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: Pembrolizumab is a novel immunotherapy agent that improves oncological outcomes in various cancer types. Although there are minor immune-related adverse events (irAEs) when used alone, various irAEs have been reported when it is combined with chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to investigate irAEs that occurred after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with pembrolizumab based on the KEYNOTE-522 regimen for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to identify fatal irAEs that should be corrected before surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Between 2022 and 2024, a total of, 71 cases from 81 patients who completed NAC with pembrolizumab based on KEYNOTE-522 regimen (wP/Cab and pembrolizumab followed by AC and pembrolizumab) followed by surgery were reviewed based on their medical records. All irAEs that occurred were investigated and classified into five categories: systemic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and endocrine. Underlying diseases that existed before the diagnosis of breast cancer or complications that occurred after surgery were excluded. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.62 (SD, ±10.6) years, and the stages at diagnosis were as follows: IIA (n=23, 32.4%), IIB (n=22, 31.0%), IIIA (n=14, 16.2%), IIIB (n=1, 1.4%), and IIIC (n=11, 15.5%). After NAC with pembrolizumab, the pCR rate was 49.3% (35/71) Fifty-three patients (62.2%) experienced adverse events, and the number of adverse events were as follows: 1 (n=11, 20.8%), 2 (n=20, 37.7%), and ≥3 (n=22, 41.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common (n=46, 86.8%), and dermatologic symptoms were the second most common (n=31, 58.5%). Among fatal irAEs, including colitis and pneumonitis, they occurred in 11 patients (20.8%) and 2 patients (3.8%), respectively. There was no case of hepatitis, myocarditis, or hypophysitis as fatal irAEs after NAC and pembrolizumab for TNBC. Among these irAEs, thyroid disorders (n=16, 22.5%) were the most common adverse event after skin rash and nausea. Of the patients with thyroid disorders, 3 experienced fatal dysfunction. Their surgeries were delayed for an average of 8.5 weeks to correct the thyroid imbalance before they could safely undergo general anesthesia. The remaining patients, who did not experience such complications, were able to undergo surgery after an average of 5.2 weeks. Conclusion: The irAEs that occurred after NAC with pembrolizumab in TNBC were varied and included some that were severe enough to affect the timing of surgery under general anesthesia. Thyroid dysfunction, in particular, should be evaluated and corrected during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy to prevent delays in surgery.\n Citation Format: Byeongju Kang, Jung Eun Choi, Moohyun Lee, Ho Yong Park, Jin Hyang Jung, Soo Jung Lee, Su Hwan Kang, Jin Gu Kang, Sun Hee Kang, Jihyoung Cho, Yee Soo Chae, Soo Jung Lee, In-Hee Lee, Keon Uk Park, Hyera Kim, Jeeyeon Lee.

    "abstract" : "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Currently, programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have become the first choice for breast cancer immunotherapies. Despite paclitaxel being considered a cornerstone drug in breast cancer treatment, the effectiveness, safety, and optimal drug selection for its combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors remain uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, performing a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database through May 18, 2024. Selected trials were those that assessed the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for the treatment of TNBC. The primary endpoint assessed was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), overall response rate (ORR), and Pathological complete response (pCR). This study is registered in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023429651. Results: A total of 8 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria were included, involving 4626 patients who received either Paclitaxel (Paclitaxel-placebo/chemotherapy) or a combination of durvalumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, toripalimab with paclitaxel. The pooled results demonstrated that Durvalumab combined with Paclitaxel significantly reduced the hazard ratio for OS (surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA]: 91.05%) and PFS compared with Paclitaxel alone (SUCRA: 83.52%). Additionally, Durvalumab plus Paclitaxel significantly improved the ORR compared with Paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10–5.20). For safety outcomes, Atezolizumab plus Paclitaxel showed a favorable profile in AEs, with no significant differences observed between groups. In the pCR study, Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel was the most effective treatment option (SUCRA: 81.85%). Conclusions: When combined with paclitaxel, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibit a favorable survival benefit. The combination of Durvalumab and paclitaxel represents the optimal treatment option. In the future, attention should be paid to the TNBC subtypes and drug dosage, as these factors may help to design personalized TNBC treatment programs."

    "abstract" : "RATIONALE\nPreserving health-related quality of life is an aspect of care that requires constant attention from the time of cancer diagnosis. Melatonin has been used to diminish treatment-related side effects and cancer symptoms, and as a medication to regulate circadian rhythm. An up-to-date systematic review is needed to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of melatonin for preserving health-related quality of life and sleep in cancer patients.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nTo identify studies for inclusion in this review, we used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 10 other databases, and four trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 10 September 2024.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer of any stage that evaluated melatonin (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment) versus no treatment or placebo (alone or in combination with standard anticancer treatment), or standard anticancer treatment. Standard anticancer treatment refers to treatments to stop or prevent cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy).\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and sleep quality within three months, and melatonin-related adverse events. Other outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, tumour response, and anticancer treatment-related harms.\n\n\nRISK OF BIAS\nWe used Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies included in the review.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS METHODS\nWe synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If this was not possible, due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results in a narrative format. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n\nINCLUDED STUDIES\nWe identified 30 RCTs (reported in 49 publications) involving 5093 adult participants with cancer (2470 males, 2228 females, 395 not reported). Studies were conducted in a hospital setting and took place in at least 10 countries. We assessed two studies at low risk of bias and the other 28 at high risk of bias.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS OF RESULTS\nMelatonin plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life score (MD 2.60, 95% CI -14.53 to 19.73; 1 study, 126 participants; very low certainty evidence), and sleep score (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.42; 1 study, 50 participants; very low certainty evidence) within three months. We are also very uncertain about potential adverse effects of melatonin: headache (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 23.14; 1 study, 25 participants; very low certainty evidence); fatigue (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 2 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty evidence); and nausea (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.56; 1 study, 146 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of high risk of bias, small sample size, the width of the 95% confidence interval, and indirectness due to inadequate reporting of cancer type. Melatonin plus standard treatment versus standard treatment No data are available relating to quality of life and sleep within three months. The evidence is very uncertain about headaches (experienced by 15 of 820 participants in melatonin groups, with no data available for control groups; 2 studies, 1640 participants; very low certainty evidence). Melatonin likely reduces the incidence of fatigue (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.55; 10 studies, 1359 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00; 6 studies, 710 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data are available relating to dizziness. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias and the width of the 95% confidence interval. Melatonin (topical use) plus standard treatment versus placebo plus standard treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of melatonin on quality of life (one study reported no difference between groups, both having the same median score of 66.7; 48 participants; very low certainty evidence). No data are available relating to sleep and adverse events (including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the high risk of bias, small sample size, and insufficient data.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe available evidence is of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of melatonin on quality of life and sleep at three months in people receiving treatment for cancer. There may be no difference in adverse events between melatonin plus standard treatment and placebo plus standard treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Data were lacking for some outcomes, such as dizziness. Melatonin used alongside standard treatment probably reduces the risk of fatigue and may reduce nausea when compared to standard treatment alone. Since the evidence base for melatonin in people with cancer is limited due to insufficient data and risks of bias in study design, the decision for or against using melatonin as an adjunct to cancer treatment cannot easily be made at the current time.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThis Cochrane Review was partially funded by AG Biologische Krebstherapie, Deutsche Krebshilfe (grant numbers 70-301 and 109863).

    "abstract" : "Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very common type of head and neck cancer, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 50%. Inhibitors targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway have gained widespread clinical adoption. However, the relationship between the infiltration characteristics of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effect of immunotherapy on HNSCC remains to be explored. Methods Patients diagnosed with HNSCC who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy were reviewed between February 2021 and March 30, 2024, in our single center. The laryngoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathologic response were evaluated to the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Result Our analysis involved 42 patients who received Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients underwent surgical treatment following the completion of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Among them, 6 patients achieved pCR (33%). The 1-year OS rate of the 42 patients enrolled in the study was 95.05%, and the 1-year PFS rate was 89.86%. There was a significant positive correlation between the lymphocyte density in HNSCC prior to the administration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy and the immunotherapy efficacy. Compared with pretreatment, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly decreased, and the lymphocyte density was significantly increased in HNSCC patients after immunotherapy. Conclusions The integration of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective strategy, can improve the tumor response rate and survival rate, and is a valuable treatment for patients with HNSCC. Furthermore, the study suggests that an elevated NLR within the HNSCC tumor microenvironment could potentially serve as a biomarker indicative of diminished immunotherapy efficacy.

    "abstract" : "\n e20593\n \n \n Background:\n Tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is emerging as a promising immunotherapy agent and has demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability in recent lung cancer trials. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of Tislelizumab, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy (Group 1), as a superior treatment alternative for lung cancer compared to standard chemotherapy (Group 2) in improving patient outcomes.\n Methods:\n Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to December 2024 to identify Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Hazards ratio (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) were generated, by employing a Random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. Our outcomes of interest were Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of response (DOR), and treatment-related adverse Events.\n Results:\n A total of 6 RCTs involving 2107 patients were included for analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that Group 1 significantly improved PFS, OS, and DOR with HRs of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.71-1.99; p <0.00001, I² = 0%), 2.01 (95% CI: 1.75-2.29; p <0.00001, I² = 0%) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.52-3.03; p <0.0001, I² = 39%), respectively. Group 1 has better DCR and ORR compared to Group 2 with RRs of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12-2.07; p= 0.007, I² = 97%) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.20-1.86; p= 0.0003, I² = 83%), respectively. The high heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis of DCR (I² = 97%) and ORR (I² = 83%) likely reflects variability in study populations, treatment protocols, and response assessment criteria across the included RCTs. Subgroup or sensitivity analyses could help identify contributing factors. Despite the heterogeneity, the pooled effect sizes indicate a statistically significant improvement in DCR and ORR with Tislelizumab, with caution warranted when generalizing these findings. Group 1 significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared to Group 2 (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.95; p = 0.0003), with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%). No significant differences were found in adverse events, except for ALT elevations. (RR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14–1.61; p = 0.0006, I² = 25%).\n Conclusions:\n Tislelizumab, with or without chemotherapy, demonstrates greater PFS and OS benefits compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with lung cancer. There was a significantly reduced all-cause mortality in the intervention group; however, the observed increase in the risk of ALT elevation underscores the need for vigilant liver function monitoring. When combined with chemotherapy, Tislelizumab presents a promising treatment option for lung cancer.\n"

    "abstract" : "8513 Background: A multinational pivotal study WU-KONG1 (NCT03974022) has been conducted to assess sunvozertinib (DZD9008) in pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (exon20ins). Here we report the results of primary analysis. Methods: WU-KONG1 Part B is a phase 2, multinational pivotal study to assess the antitumor efficacy of sunvozertinib at two dose levels, 200 mg and 300 mg, in platinum pre-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon20ins. Eligible patients were randomized at the ratio of 1:1 to receive 200 mg or 300 mg sunvozertinib once daily until discontinuation criteria were met. Randomization was stratified by brain metastasis at baseline and number of regimens of prior systemic anti-cancer therapy. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) (per RECIST v1.1) and key secondary endpoint included IRC assessed duration of response (DoR). Results: As of January 4, 2024, a total of 184 patients were randomized to receive sunvozertinib treatment at 200 mg or 300 mg. Patients who met the predefined criteria for efficacy analysis were included in the primary analysis. The majority of patients (96.0%) had metastatic diseases, 60.7% had ECOG PS of 1, and 23.7% had baseline brain metastasis. All patients received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and 43.4% and 13.3% had prior onco-immunotherapy or amivantamab treatment. Per IRC assessment, the best ORR was 54.3% (41.0% confirmed and 5.8% pending confirmation). Confirmed complete response (CR) was achieved in 2.9% patients. The disease control rate (including CR, PR and stable disease) was 90.8%. The primary endpoint met its predefined target, with statistical significance. Tumor response was observed in patients with baseline brain metastasis, different demographics and EGFR exon20ins subtypes. With median follow-up time of 5.5 months for responders, the duration of response has not been reached, with 74.6% responders still responding. The PFS data are not mature with approximately 6-month follow-up. Safety findings were similar to previously reported results of sunvozertinib in other clinical studies. The most common drug-related TEAEs included diarrhea, skin rash and CPK increase. The majority of the TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and clinically manageable. Conclusions: In this primary analysis of WU-KONG1 multinational pivotal study, sunvozertinib demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in platinum pre-treated NSCLC with EGFR exon20ins, with a tolerable safety profile. The updated data will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT03974022 ."

The development of increasingly potent cancer treatments has helped to improve cancer survival, but at the potential cost of cardiovascular toxicity. These cardiovascular complications can occur during or after cancer treatment, in short, medium or long term. This study aims to provide an overview of the clinical activity of the first nurse-led cardio-oncology clinic in the United Kingdom.\n \n \n \n This is a single centre, retrospective, observational cohort study reviewing our cardio-oncology clinic activity from 2023 to 2024. Patients receiving cancer treatment were included if they were referred to the nurse-led clinic for treatment and management of their cardiovascular condition before, during or after treatment.\n \n \n \n 534 patients were seen in the nurse-led Cardio-Oncology clinic, 102 of these patients were new referrals who were then followed up throughout the year from 2023-2024. The mean age of the patients was 65+14 years old and 46 (45%) were male. Amongst the new referrals, haematological and breast malignancies were most common (27.4% and 30.3% respectively), followed by lung and sarcoma malignancies (both 7.8%). Eighteen (17.6%) were treated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies, 23.5% of patient received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Seven (6.8%) received immunotherapy, 10 (9.8%) received radiotherapy, 8 patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 (2.9%) received taxane, 5 (5.8%) were treated with 5FU and 1 (0.9%) CDKi inhibitor. Six (5.8%) patients had surgery and two (1.9%) underwent stem cell transplants. Six (5.8%) patients had combination therapy and 8 (7.8%) had other disease-specific treatments.\n Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) was most common cardiovascular complication in 33 (32.3%) of patients referred, then 14 cases of (13.7%) HF with preserved EF, arrhythmia in 12 (11.7%), 10 (9.8%) presented with chest pain, 15 (14.7%) treated for hypertension and 9 (8.8%) referred prior to chemotherapy.\n More than half of the HF referrals (30.3%) resulted from cancer treatment-related heart dysfunction.\n Sixty-two (60.7%) patients referred were only having nurse-led follow-up in the Cardio-Oncology clinic and were no longer being seen in the doctor’s clinic. Forty-two (41.1%) continued cardiotoxic cancer treatment with monitoring in nurse-led clinic and 12 (11.7%) patients died due to cancer disease progression.\n \n \n \n The Cardio-Oncology nurse-led clinic encompasses holistic patient care and permits rapid up-titration of medications to optimal target dosages, resulting in treatment of cardiovascular conditions thus significant improvements in cardiac function, education, and support of side effect management. This allows uninterrupted continuation of cancer treatment, with the potential to translate into better long-term cancer and cardiovascular outcomes.  Figure 1table continued\n"

    "abstract" : "Background/Objectives: The need for innovative cancer treatments has brought immunotherapies to the forefront as a promising approach, with therapeutic vaccines demonstrating the potential to mobilize immune cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, challenges such as genetic variability among patients, immune evasion mechanisms, and disease relapse contribute to the complexity of achieving an ideal therapy, especially for hematological cancers. This review systematically identifies and analyzes recent studies focused on the development of therapeutic immunotherapy vaccines, examining critical aspects such as development stages, key assays for therapeutic validation, treatment outcomes, and study limitations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension guidelines (PRISMA-ScR). Literature searches were conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases using keywords including “immunotherapy”, “vaccines”, “immunization”, “hematological malignancies”, “blood cancer”, “hematopoietic neoplasms”, and “leukemia”. Results: A total of 56 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were included in the analysis. The majority of studies are in the preclinical stage, with some advancing to phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Acute myeloid leukemia emerged as the most frequently studied malignancy. While first- and second-generation vaccines dominate the field, innovative approaches, such as dendritic-cell-based vaccines and mRNA vaccines, are gaining prominence. Notably, preclinical models often demonstrate superior outcomes compared to clinical trials, as results observed in animal models are not fully replicated in human studies. Conclusions: Despite challenges related to disease progression and patient loss, the studies reviewed highlight significant advancements in patient prognosis, emphasizing the potential of novel therapeutic vaccines as an effective alternative for the treatment of hematological cancers."

    "abstract" : "\n Background: Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (mTLS) predict improved outcome in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, a significant proportion of patients with TLS-positive tumors do not respond to ICI when used as a single agent and may therefore benefit from combination therapy. The multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib, deplete regulatory T cells, an immune population associated with resistance to ICI in TLS-positive tumors. We report the results of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab combined with regorafenib in patients with mTLS-positive advanced solid tumors.\n Methods: ‘Regomune’ is an open-label, multicenter phase II study assessing the combination of avelumab (10mg/kg IV every 14 days) with regorafenib (160 mg daily for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle) in patients with advanced mTLS-positive solid tumors. The mTLS status was centrally assessed as previously described (Vanhersecke et al Nature Cancer 2021). All patients had confirmed progressive disease at inclusion, based on a central review of imaging. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 6-month non-progression rate using RECIST v1.1 based on blinded central review. 29 assessable patients were deemed necessary, and to meet the primary endpoint, at least 8 patients needed to be progression-free at 6 months.\n Results: Between January 2021 and July 2022, 132 patients (5 centers) underwent mTLS screening. Of these, 55 (41.7%) were identified as mTLS+, and 38 were included in the study. The top five histological subtypes were MSS colorectal cancer (15.8%), sarcoma (13.1%), oesogastric (10.5%), biliary tract (7.9%), and pancreatic cancer (7.9%). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (23.7%), maculo-papular rash (18.4%), fatigue, and oral mucositis (7.9% each). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Of the 34 patients assessed for efficacy, 16 (47%) showed tumor shrinkage, with 9 achieving a partial response (26.7%) and 7 having stable disease (20.6%). The median duration of response was 6 months. Twelve patients (comprising various tumor types including MSS colorectal cancer, small bowel carcinomas, biliary tract cancer, sarcomas, thyroid and gynecological tumors.) were progression-free at 6 months, marking the study’s primary endpoint achievement. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.6 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of tumor tissues, and comprehensive plasma proteomics analysis have collectively uncovered critical biomarkers that significantly determine both sensitivity and resistance to treatment.\n Conclusions: This is the first histology-agnostic clinical trial employing mTLS as a biomarker for patient selection for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen. Durable responses were recorded, even in cases typically resistant to immunotherapy, confirming the predictive value of mTLS.\n Trial Registration NCT03475953\n Citation Format: Antoine Italiano, Sophie Cousin, Carine Bellera, Jean-Philippe Guegan, Jean-Philippe Metges, Antoine Adenis, Rastilav Bahleda, Philippe Cassier, Coralie Cantarel, Michele Kind, Jean Palussiere, Lucile Vanhersecke, Alban Bessede.

Долгое время адъювантная химиотерапия оставалась единственной лекарственной опцией адъювантного лечения пациентов с немелкоклеточным раком лёгкого (НМРЛ) IB–IIIA стадий. Необходимость открытия новых подходов в адъювантном лечении НМРЛ, безусловно, связана с невысокими результатами общей выживаемости и с высоким риском рецидива рака лёгкого после проведения исключительно химиотерапии. В ходе эволюции знаний о биологии опухоли, о молекулярных механизмах развития и распространения рака появилось два новых направления адъювантной терапии – таргетная и иммунотерапия. В этом обзоре рассматриваются исследования III фазы, результаты которых продемонстрировали улучшение показателей выживаемости у пациентов, получивших инновационную адъювантную терапию, что позволило внедрить новые опции адъювантной терапии НМРЛ в клиническую практику. Также отражены сроки внедрения этих опций в практические рекомендации.\n Lung cancer is a relevant oncological disease with a high incidence rate and relatively modest treatment results. For a long time, adjuvant chemotherapy remained the only drug option for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IB–IIIA. The necessity to discover new approaches to the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC is certainly associated with low overall survival results and a high risk of lung cancer relapse after chemotherapy alone. In the course of the evolution of knowledge about tumor biology, molecular mechanisms of cancer development and spread, two new areas of adjuvant therapy have emerged - targeted and immunotherapy. This review discusses phase III studies, the results of which demonstrated improved survival rates in patients who received innovative adjuvant therapy, which made it possible to introduce new options for adjuvant therapy for NSCLC into clinical practice. The timeframes for the implementation of these options in practical recommendations are also reflected."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with global impact, especially in the context of the rising epidemic of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape for HCC is evolving and has changed significantly in the last few years with new treatment options for patients, while the multidisciplinary team model of care remains critical. This review aims to summarize the various treatment options for patients at all stages of HCC, highlighting the growing array of systemic therapies with multi-modal options, including the potential of combining locoregional therapies with immunotherapy across different stages of the disease. With the increasing recognition of the importance of patient-centered care, the future paradigm of HCC care includes the incorporation of non-hospice palliative care in the multidisciplinary team care model to improve patient quality of care, quality of life, and overall outcomes. Abstract Liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes up the majority of liver cancer cases. Despite the stabilization of incidence rates in recent years due to effective viral hepatitis treatments, as well as improved outcomes from early detection and treatment advances, the burden of HCC is anticipated to rise again due to increasing rates of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease. The treatment landscape is evolving and requires a multidisciplinary approach, often involving multi-modal treatments that include surgical resection, transplantation, local regional therapies, and systemic treatments. The optimal approach to the care of the HCC patient requires a multidisciplinary team involving hepatology, medical oncology, diagnostic and interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and surgery. In order to determine which approach is best, an individualized treatment plan should consider the patient’s liver function, functional status, comorbidities, cancer stage, and preferences. In this review, we provide an overview of the current treatment options and key trials that have revolutionized the management of HCC. We also discuss evolving treatment paradigms for the future."

    "abstract" : "Simple Summary Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, requiring new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This research arises from the need to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The authors aim to systematically evaluate the potential of emerging biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNAs and mutational load of blood tumors and their relationship with different treatments. The findings of this study could have a significant impact on the research community by providing a basis for integrating these biomarkers into clinical practice, thereby improving personalized treatment strategies and patient outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. Abstract Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, often diagnosed at advanced stages, which diminishes the effective treatment options and survival rates. This systematic review assesses the utility of emerging biomarkers—circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB)—enhanced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the diagnostic accuracy, prognostic evaluation, and treatment strategies in NSCLC. Analyzing data from 37 studies involving 10,332 patients from 2020 to 2024, the review highlights how biomarkers like ctDNA and PD-L1 expression critically inform the selection of personalized therapies, particularly beneficial in the advanced stages of NSCLC. These biomarkers are critical for prognostic assessments and in dynamically adapting treatment plans, where high PD-L1 expression and specific genetic mutations (e.g., ALK fusions, EGFR mutations) significantly guide the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The findings recommend integrating these biomarkers into standardized clinical pathways to maximize their potential in enhancing the treatment precision, ultimately fostering significant advancements in oncology and improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review substantiates the prognostic and predictive value of these biomarkers and emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation in biomarker research."

    "abstract" : "\n Introduction: The treatment algorithm following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) remains uncertain. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and the first network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs (or combined new drugs) for the treatment of Hormone Receptor-Positive/HER2-Negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) in patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with CDK4/6i. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched from 2000 to 2024 and conference proceedings from major congresses of the last two years were retrieved. Two authors independently performed the screening, three authors extracted data, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) as secondary endpoints. The new drugs (or combined new drugs) were compared to either standard chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy alone (ET) in second-line and beyond treatment settings. Network meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, calculating risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and chi-square test. Results: A total of 4034 papers were identified, after removing duplicates. Out of the 67 studies screened in full-text, 26 clinical trials were selected, encompassing a total of 7083 patients and five different drug classes. Specifically, 9 studies included biological agnostic therapy (CDK4/6i, mTOR inhibitors, immunotherapy), 7 novel ET (including selective estrogen receptor degraders – oral SERD), 5 targeted therapies (PI3K, AKT and PARP inhibitors), 3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs: trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd] and sacituzumab govitecan), and 2 CT (eribulin, VEX metronomic). Control arms consisted of either ET alone (mainly fulvestrant) or standard CT (paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All network estimates coincided with pairwise estimates as no direct comparison between the new drugs existed in the literature. Among all therapies, T-DXd showed the largest PFS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.51 (CI: 0.45 – 0.57)], followed by ribociclib plus ET compared to ET alone [HR 0.57 (CI: 0.45 – 0.72)]. Interaction tests conducted among the five drug classes showed a significant different positive effect on PFS by targeted therapies [HR 0.61 (CI: 0.57 – 0.66)] compared to ET alone (p-value 0.009) but failed to identify significant differences in PFS among the different drug classes compared to CT (p-value 0.16), although ADCs showed a larger effect in PFS [HR 0.63 (CI: 0.50 – 0.80)]. Although ADCs showed the largest OS benefit compared to standard CT [HR 0.72 (CI: 0.58 – 0.89)], the interaction test among the drug classes was not significant (p-value 0.10), and similarly no interaction was observed for ORR. Conversely, the interaction test for toxicity indicates a significant difference between the five drug classes compared to ET, with biological agnostic therapy showing greater toxicity [HR 4.81 (CI: 3.18 – 7.25)] compared to other treatment options. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis showed that targeted therapies, such as PI3K, AKT, and PARP inhibitors, demonstrate significant improvement in PFS compared to ET with a positive interaction test among the different drug classes. Biological agnostic therapies offer some survival improvement but at the cost of increased toxicity as compared to other options. These findings could help tailor the most suitable treatment for each patient, determining the optimal sequence following progression to CDK4/6i for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC.\n Citation Format: Mariangela Gaudio, Michela Cinquini, Flavia Jacobs, Cristina Mazzi, Valter Torri, Antonino Carmelo Tralongo, Chiara Benvenuti, Riccardo Gerosa, Jacopo Canzian, Giuseppe Saltalamacchia, Rita de Sanctis, Armando Santoro, Alberto Zambelli.

    "abstract" : "\n Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 amplification. This unique molecular profile limits treatment options, as TNBC does not respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies, making chemotherapy the cornerstone of systemic treatment. Achieving a complete pathologic response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved long-term outcomes and survival rates in TNBC patients. However, pCR rates can vary significantly depending on the chemotherapy regimen used, as well as the inclusion of other modalities such as immunotherapy. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted at Chihuahua's State Cancer Center, where medical records of patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with TNBC between January 2012 and June 2023 were reviewed to evaluate pCR after neoadjuvant treatment. The study compared the effectiveness of three chemotherapy regimens: anthracyclines and taxanes (AC-T), anthracyclines combined with taxanes and carboplatin (AC-Tcarboplatin), and any chemotherapy regimen paired with immunotherapy (IT). Fisher's exact tests were used to compare pCR rates across these groups, with p-values calculated to determine clinical significance and identify the most effective treatment strategies. In total, 1279 breast cancer patients were included, with 182 (14.23%) diagnosed with TNBC. Among these, 92 (50.55%) received neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in 35 (19.23%) achieving pCR. Upon observing the pCR rates among different regimens, we found clinical relevance in the variations. Statistically significant differences were confirmed when comparing neoadjuvant treatments in relation to pCR rates (p=0.029). Sixty patients received the AC-T regimen, achieving a pCR rate of 26.67%. Thirteen patients received AC-Tcarboplatin, with a pCR rate of 46.15%. Thirteen patients received chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, showing a high pCR rate of 92.31%. Finally, 6 patients received other chemotherapy regimens without immunotherapy or carboplatin, with only 1 (16.67%) achieving pCR.This analysis highlights significant differences in pCR rates depending on the administered treatment, emphasizing firstly the clear benefits of adding carboplatin to the neoadjuvant regimen. Additionally, although the number of patients treated with immunotherapy was limited, the results unequivocally indicate its benefit in significantly enhancing complete pathological responses compared to other treatment groups. While each therapeutic group demonstrated specific advantages in pCR rates, stressing the critical importance of early access to advanced therapeutic options such as immunotherapy from the time of TNBC diagnosis is crucial. Finally, it is recommended to establish better public policies to improve access to these treatments and explore the potential additional benefits of low-dose immunotherapy in future research to further optimize clinical outcomes.\n Citation Format: Enrique José Zamudio Lozoya, Luisa Fernanda González-González, Victor Baylon-Valdez, Paolo Mendoza-Muraira, Regina Martínez-García-Lascurain, Patricio Ochoa Elizondo, Rafael Martínez-Sanciprián, Beatriz De León-Jiménez, Alma Andrea Elizaldi-San Miguel, Gustavo Gil Reza Bravo, América Susana Mares García, René Lázaro González-Mendoza.

    "abstract" : "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are iron-dependent and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). All three epigenetic modifications are intermediates in DNA demethylation. TET proteins are recruited by transcription factors and by RNA polymerase II to modify 5mC at enhancers and gene bodies, thereby regulating gene expression during development, cell lineage specification, and cell activation. It is not yet clear, however, how the established biochemical activities of TET enzymes in oxidizing 5mC and mediating DNA demethylation relate to the known association of TET deficiency with inflammation, clonal hematopoiesis, and cancer. There are hints that the ability of TET deficiency to promote cell proliferation in a signal-dependent manner may be harnessed for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we draw upon recent findings in cells of the immune system to illustrate established as well as emerging ideas of how TET proteins influence cellular function.

    "abstract" : "Background. Obesity and diabetes mellitus significantly increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively affect the survival of these patients. Colorectal cancer and diabetes mellitus share common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Metformin is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide. In addition to its hypoglycemic effect, metformin has anti-tumor effects, which has stimulated interest in researching metformin as a potential method of preventing CRC and slowing its progression. \nPurpose – to highlight the results of studies of the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of metformin in colorectal cancer patients. \nMaterials and methods. Data searches for the review were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Research data published in 2014–2024 were analyzed and systematized. \nResults. Epidemiologic studies of recent decades have shown that patients with T2DM taking metformin have a lower risk of colorectal adenomas and CRC developing and a better prognosis. There is some evidence of a protective role of the drug in patients without diabetes. It was found that the risk of developing CRC depends on the dose and duration of metformin use. Use of metformin is associated with improved survival of patients with both early stages of CRC and metastatic disease. However, some publications have not proven a relationship between metformin use and the risk of CRC and survival of these patients, which requires an analysis of the reasons for these discrepancies. The experience of using metformin in combination with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and immunotherapy in patients with CRC is currently limited to a small number of studies with small patient samples. A moderate improvement in antitumor efficacy was observed with the combination of metformin with 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan in patients with refractory metastatic CRC. Recent studies have shown promising antitumor activity of the combination of metformin with polychemotherapy in CRC treatment. In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with diabetes mellitus, the degree of tumor regression and reduction of lymph node lesion after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy was higher in the group receiving metformin than in the group of patients not using this drug. Similar results were obtained in patients without diabetes. The increase in antitumor activity in the combination of metformin with immune checkpoint blockers observed in preclinical studies, was not confirmed in patients with stage IV microsatellite stable CRC. \nConclusions. Observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality among people receiving metformin. The drug has also been shown to be beneficial for diabetic patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients receiving the combination treatment had better pathologic responses compared to patients who did not take the drug. At the same time, studies of the combined use of metformin with chemotherapeutic drugs are limited mainly to small single-arm trials. Randomized clinical trials with large numbers of CRC patients are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of metformin in combination with standard anticancer treatment."

    "abstract" : "Background Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert a potential clinical enhancing effect in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), while antibiotics exert a detrimental impact. Prior meta-analysis papers have substantial limitations and are devoid of recent published studies. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis and, for the first time, assess whether probiotics can restore the damage of antibiotics to immunotherapy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three English databases and three Chinese databases with a cutoff date of August 11, 2024. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) or the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2). Engauge Digitizer v12.1 was employed to extract hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for survival outcomes when these data were not explicitly provided in the manuscripts. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 14 software. Results The study sample comprised eight retrospective and four prospective studies, involving a total of 3,142 participants. The findings indicate that probiotics significantly prolong the overall survival (OS) (I2 = 31.2%; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.73, p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (I2 = 65.2%; HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.81, p < 0.001) in cancer patients receiving ICIs, enhance the objective response rate (ORR) (I2 = 33.5%; OR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.40, p = 0.001) and disease control rate (DCR) (I2 = 50.0%; OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.35, p = 0.002). For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exposed to antibiotics, the use of probiotics was associated with superior OS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.34-0.59, p < 0.001) and PFS (I2 = 0.0%; HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.38-0.62, p < 0.001) when compared to non-users. Subgroup differences were observed regarding the cancer type (P=0.006) and ethnic backgrounds (P=0.011) in OS. Conclusions The meta-analysis findings suggest that probiotics can effectively extend the survival of cancer treated with ICIs. In NSCLC, probiotics appear to mitigate the negative impact of antibiotics on immunotherapy effectiveness, which has profound clinical significance. Nevertheless, additional large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to further validate these findings.

Accumulating research suggests that patients with ARID gene alterations of the human switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complex are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. To investigate the correlation between ARID gene alterations/RNA expression levels and clinical outcomes after immunotherapies, we reviewed patients with solid malignancies seen at our Institute.\n \n \n \n A review of patients (from 2014 to 2024) with solid malignancies from our clinical database at the Avera Cancer Institute, whose tissue DNA and RNA were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) by Tempus and Foundation Medicine, Inc. Patients who have alterations in the ARID gene (ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2 and ARID5B) and received therapeutic regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs, including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors) alone or in combination with other treatments were assembled as Cohort 1. Patients with wild-type ARID gene and received ICIs were used as Cohort 2. The outcome differences of the patients between Cohort 1 and 2 were then assessed. Furthermore, patients in Cohort 1 were stratified to subgroups by RNA levels, microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, and the outcomes were analyzed.\n \n \n \n 1. Of the 3620 patients in our database, we found 591 (16.3%) patients harboring ARID gene alterations with one of 15 types of cancer. This includes 160 (4.4% of 3620 and 27.1% of 591 patients) patients (Cohort 1) that received ICIs (excluding 10 patients unevaluable due to treatment termination per drug toxicity or lack of follow-up information), and 470 (13.0%) patients (Cohort 2) with wild-type ARID gene received ICIs. 2. No statistical difference of RNA expression level between Cohort 1 (N= 50) and Cohort 2 (N= 135). 3. Patients in Cohort 1 (N= 160), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) measured from date of the initiation of ICIs were 8.3 and 20.3 months. 4. PFS and OS of patients in Cohort 2 appear less than in Cohort 1. Assessment for patients of Cohort 2 and subgroups is ongoing. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.\n \n \n \n Improved response rates to ICIs will require the efforts of researchers and clinicians to advance our understanding of tumor immunology, biology as well as omics and to integrate them with other important components of precision oncology.

This review is the first of an annual series exploring the latest in‐patient developments in several key areas, focusing on mechanisms. We present advances in the use and action of several therapies including epigenetic modulators, protein degraders, apoptotic inducers, gene editing, and immunotherapy. We discuss the individual molecular mechanisms and clinical findings of these developments, emphasising their potential to improve survival and offer renewed hope for individuals with blood cancer.

Recent studies have elucidated a strong relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) using single-cell multi-omics technology. In this study, we aim to develop predictive models for both objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) using TIME features with machine learning in advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line immunotherapy.\n Methods: A total of 210 patients with advanced NSCLC who received anti-PD-1/PDL-1 therapy at Shanghai Chest Hospital from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2023 were included in this study. Among them, 110 cases who received pembrolizumab were randomly split into training set and validation set with a 2:1 ratio. The remaining patients were designated as independent validation cohort. Five multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) panels were developed based on literature review and in-house dataset mining. mIHC tests were performed using baseline tumor samples. Immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by ORR and PFS (RECIST v1.1). ORR and PFS models were developed using machine learning methods in training set with 5-fold cross-validation and further validated in validation set and independent validation cohort.\n Results: After data cleaning, 68 cases in training set and 34 cases in validation set were further analyzed. In terms of single immune- or spatial- based biomarker, positive rate of PD1+ cells in stroma and spatial relationship of PD1+/PDL1+ cell pairs exhibited the highest correlation with ORR. In addition, positive rate of PDL1+ tumor cells and nearest distance between FOXP3+ cells and tumor cells were highly correlated with PFS. Our ORR model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in the training set and 0.82 in the validation set. When applying optimal cutoff in our PFS model to stratify patients into low- and high- risk groups, low-risk group showed prolonged PFS in both training set (p < 0.0001; HR: 0.25, 95% CI [0.13 - 0.51]) and validation set (p = 0.00046; HR: 0.22, 95% CI [0.09 - 0.55]). Moreover, our ORR model outperformed PDL1 IHC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.60; DeLong’s test p = 0.005) in these 102 patients. Independent validation of the models is still awaited.\n Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we developed and validated ORR and PFS predictive models for first-line immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients based on mIHC technology. Our models displayed superior diagnostic performance compared to PDL1 IHC results.\n Citation Format: Chan Xiang, Jianjian Zheng, Sidong Chen, Zhanxian Shang, Shi Yang, Lianying Guo, Lei Jiao, Yang Wang, Yuchen Han.

    "abstract" : "GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS) is a prototypic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system with a global incidence from 0.16 to 4.0/100,000 per year [1]. The following immunological mechanisms are discussed in the pathogenesis of GBS, namely molecular mimicry, epitope spread, bystander activation, superantigen production, and aberrant activation of the complement cascade [2]. Since its discovery in 1989, the IL33/ST2 axis has been explored in different types of immunological disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchial asthma, Behçet's disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, and others. Interleukin33 (IL33) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the interleukin1 family capable of inducing the production of T helper type 2 (Th2) pathway cytokines (IL4, IL5, IL6, and IL13) and enhancing Th1, Th2, and Th17 immunological responses [3]. It is the only ligand for its receptor ST2 (T1 or IL1RL1/interleukin1 receptorlike 1), which belongs to the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) superfamily. ST2 is expressed constitutively in different immune cells such as Th2 lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells. The ST2 receptor has two distinct isoforms, namely a membranebound form (ST2), responsible for nuclear factor (NF)κβ and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MyD88/NFκβ) pathway signaling, and a soluble form (sST2), a decoy receptor responsible for halting the NFκβ signal via IL33 sequestration [4]. IL33 is also known as ‘alarmin’ because of its property of being secreted by epithelial cells to alert the immune cells (which express ST2 receptor) in response to infection and inflammation [5]. The human IL33/ST2 axis plays an important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune disorders. The genetic dysregulation of this IL33/ST2 axis can influence susceptibility to different immunological diseases by means of mechanisms such as impairment of ligandbinding capacity and alteration of geneproduct expression due to the direct regulatory effects of free IL33 on transcription of DNA by virtue of its DNAbinding domain [6]. The present study by Sharma et al. is an elegant study whereby they explored the IL33/ST2 axis in GBS. The findings of this study suggest the influence of the IL33/ST2 axis in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. The authors found that genetic variants of the IL1RL1 gene (CC genotype of rs10192157 and TT genotype of rs10206753) along with gene– gene interaction between IL33 and IL1RL1 genes were significantly associated with GBS [7]. They also observed elevated sST2 plasma concentrations in severe GBS patients, which they proposed as a potential biomarker of severity in GBS. These findings should be validated in larger studies. From the perspective of a neurologist, the clinical relevance of this novel immunological research is that it opens up a new domain in understanding the pathogenesis of GBS with respect to the IL33/ST2 axis. Despite advances in medical science, a biomarker for disease severity in GBS is yet to be discovered. Furthermore, future therapy can be aimed at targeting ST2 receptor signal blocking in GBS to curb the magnitude of inflammation and to expand the armamentarium of immune therapy in GBS."

    "abstract" : "T cell modulation plays a fundamental role to adaptive and innate immunity, which aids the recognition and defense against pathogens while also maintaining self-tolerance. Numerous molecular pathways participate in this process including thymic selection, T cell receptor and antigen-presenting cells cross linkage, along with co-stimulatory signaling cascades. The present review demonstrates a holistic analysis of various classic and novel mechanisms that govern T cell regulation and emerging therapeutic applications. Recent advancements have introduced novel roles in the journey of T cell modulation that can have a pivotal impact on the understanding of this process; for example, phase separation of the linker for activation of T cells, and the newer application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in autoimmune diseases. While discoveries of proximal and distal signal transduction pathways have contributed to the comprehension of T cell anergy, cytokine-mediated differentiation and the delicate balance between immune activation and tolerance, there are still unresolved debates about further molecular mechanisms. There are also still questions about the long-term side effects of CAR-T cell therapy. Deeper research and analysis are required to further aid the understanding and use of this novel therapeutic approach."

    "abstract" : "To defend against microbial invasion, the mammalian host develops a precisely regulated and complex network of cells and molecules that are also capable of discriminating among self, nonself, or missing-self. This is host immune system. The immune system is comprised of two interlinked and dynamic systems known as the innate and adaptive immune systems, and these consist of various cell-types and effector molecules to eliminate diverse threats to the host. The fundamental understanding of cellular and molecular processes adopted by the host is essential for understanding the pathogenesis and development of therapeutic interventions of disease. This issue of International Reviews of Immunology discusses the signaling events that take place during phagocytosis, immune exacerbation leading to respiratory disease, and developments in immunotherapy for blood cancer. Phagocytosis, or “cellular eating,” is mediated by various phagocytic cells of the host and plays a crucial role in various immune and nonimmune processes to maintain physiological homeostasis. The nonimmune process is required for a cleaning of the host by removing dead, old, necrotic, or traumatized cells or cell debris, and also plays an important role in developmental processes of the host. On the other hand, immunological processes are mediated by specialized innate and adaptive phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes, tissue macrophages, and B cells. The key function of these phagocytic cells is eliminating microbial pathogens, inducing inflammation and processing and presentation of microbial antigens to the adaptive immune cells. Phagocytosis is a complex molecular process and the first review article of this issue by Pradhan et al. describes the molecular mechanism of one phagocytic event known as “phagosome maturation,” in terms of phagosome and lysosome fusion, the role of calcium ions to trigger the cascade of signaling, and how microbial pathogens subvert this signaling to establish an infection. The article also provides insight into manipulation of calcium ion signaling to combat various infectious disease (Figure 1). Asthma is an obstructive lung disease characterized by the thickening of airway walls and an overproduction of mucous leading to difficulty in breathing. The asthmatic condition could be triggered by environmental factors, microbial infection, or it is associated with the host genetics. Immunologically, it develops due to an excessive presence of eosinophils and a strong T helper type 2 response through the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The second review article in this issue, by Evangelos et al., discusses the correlation between lung infection and asthma in the light of innate immune sensors, particularly toll-like receptors (Figure 1). Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is a malignant disease of lymphocytes originating from lymphatic tissue."

    "abstract" : "T helper (TH) cell polarization during priming is modulated by a number of signals, but whether polarization to a given phenotype also influences recall responses of memory TH cells is relatively unknown. Here we show that miR-181a is selectively induced in both human and mouse naive T cells differentiating into the TH17, but not TH1 or TH2 subset. In human memory TH17 cells, miR-181a regulates responses to cognate antigens through modulation of ERK phosphorylation. By enhancing the signalling cascade from the T-cell receptor, such molecular network reduces the threshold of TH17 cell activation. Moreover, at a late time point, the same network induces a self-regulatory mechanism dependent on ID3, a negative regulator of transcription factors that control RORC expression, thus modulating TH17 activity. Our results demonstrate that the phenotype acquired by TH cells during priming contributes to their threshold of activation to secondary antigenic stimulations, thus influencing memory responses. How the magnitude of the response is regulated in different T-cell memory subsets remains poorly understood. Here the authors show that miR-181 lowers the threshold of Th17 memory activation via sustained Erk phosphorylation, while Erk-dependent induction of ID3 limits Th17 activity at later time."

    "abstract" : "The angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is involved in the regulation of blood pressure (through vasoconstriction) and water and ion homeostasis (mediated by interaction with the endogenous agonist). AT1R can also be activated by auto-antibodies (AT1R-Abs), which are associated with manifold diseases, such as obliterative vasculopathy, preeclampsia and systemic sclerosis. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to AT1R-Abs binding and associated signaling cascade (dys-)regulation remains fragmentary. The goal of this study was, therefore, to investigate details of the effects of AT1R-Abs on G-protein signaling and subsequent cell proliferation, as well as the putative contribution of the three extracellular receptor loops (ELs) to Abs-AT1R signaling. AT1R-Abs induced nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling, which reflects Gq/11 and Gi activation. The impact on cell proliferation was tested in different cell systems, as well as activation-triggered receptor internalization. Blockwise alanine substitutions were designed to potentially investigate the role of ELs in AT1R-Abs-mediated effects. First, we demonstrate that Ang II-mediated internalization of AT1R is impeded by binding of AT1R-Abs. Secondly, exclusive AT1R-Abs-induced Gq/11 activation is most significant for NFAT stimulation and mediates cell proliferation. Interestingly, our studies also reveal that ligand-independent, baseline AT1R activation of Gi signaling has, in turn, a negative effect on cell proliferation. Indeed, inhibition of Gi basal activity potentiates proliferation triggered by AT1R-Abs. Finally, although AT1R containing EL1 and EL3 blockwise alanine mutations were not expressed on the human embryonic kidney293T (HEK293T) cell surface, we at least confirmed that parts of EL2 are involved in interactions between AT1R and Abs. This current study thus provides extended insights into the molecular action of AT1R-Abs and associated mechanisms of interrelated pathogenesis."

    "abstract" : "Ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a dynamic process that involves two distinctive yet interrelated phases of ischemic organ damage and inflammation‐mediated reperfusion injury. Although multiple cellular and molecular pathways contribute and regulate tissue/organ damage, integration of different players into a unified mechanism is warranted. The crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune systems plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of liver IRI. In this review, we focus on recent progress in the mechanism of liver innate immune activation by IR. Kupffer cells (KC), DCs, NK, as well as T cells initiate local inflammation response, the hallmark of IRI, by utilizing distinctive immune receptors to recognize and/or trigger various molecules, both endogenous and exogenous. The interlocked molecular signaling pathways in the context of multiple liver cell types, the IRI kinetics and positive versus negative regulatory loops in the innate immune activation process are discussed. Better appreciation of molecular interactions that mediate these intricate cascades, should allow for the development of novel therapeutic approached against IRI in liver transplant recipients."

    "abstract" : "Residual chlorine is a common by-product of warm drainage in coastal nuclear power plants. when accumulating to some limit, it may threaten marine ecosystem especially for benthic clam. However, there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms related to immunity and antioxidant of residual chlorine stress on clams. In this study, the clam (Cyclina sinensis) was exposed for 96 h at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 mg/L) of residual chlorine to observe its mortality, measure the activity of antioxidant and immune-related enzymes, and analyses the gene expression level in the hepatopancreas by using the transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the mortality rate increased with the increase of stress time and concentration, and the mortality rate in the 400, 450 and 500 mg/L groups reached 100% at 96 h. The tolerance to residual chlorine of C. sinensis decreased with the increase of chlorine dioxide concentration, and the LC50 of 96 h was 217.6 mg/L by linear regression method. After residual chlorine stress, the activity of antioxidant-related enzymes (T-AOC and SOD) in the hepatopancreas showed a trend of first increase and then decrease with the extension of stress time. The immune-related enzyme activities of AKP and LZM showed a downward trend between 0 and 96 h, while the ACP enzyme activity showed a trend of first rising and then decreasing. Transcriptome analysis showed that residual chlorine stress significantly changed the expression levels of immune-related molecules associated with signal transduction, prophenoloxidase cascade, cell apoptosis and pattern recognition protein/receptor. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase (GST), heat shock protein (HSP) and other antioxidant-related genes were significantly affected under residual chlorine stress. This study provided valuable information for understanding the effects of residual chlorine stress on survival, physiological metabolism and molecular mechanisms of immune and antioxidant functions of C. sinensis."

    "abstract" : "Dysregulation of adipose tissue functions makes a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, one of the most common diseases in recent years. Adipose tissue is an organ that secretes at least several dozen signaling molecules, adipokines. One of the most studied and at the same time mysterious adipokines is adiponectin. The latter is due to the lack of clear ideas about the biological role of this adipokine, the presence of its several molecular forms with different activity and several types of receptors to this adipokine localized in almost all cells of the body. The purpose of this review is to summarize and analyze the available information about the molecular mechanisms of the effect of adiponectin on metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and lipoproteins. The literature search was conducted by the keywords \"adiponectin\" and \"metabolic syndrome\" in the Pubmed and Elibrary.ru databases for the period from 1995 to 2021.According to the results of the literature analysis, it is assumed that adiponectin is involved in energy metabolism as a «satiety» hormone that promotes the utilization and storage of energy-rich substrates, fatty acids and glucose, which prevents the development or mitigates the already developed insulin resistance. This reduces the amount of plasma triglycerides and increases the level of high-density lipoproteins in the plasma. Adiponectin affects metabolic processes by activating the AdipoR1-APPL1-LKB1-AMPK, AdipoR1-APPL1-p38, AdipoR2-PPARa cascades, and possibly by activating the ceramidase and phosphoinositide pathways and insulin signaling. In addition to the AdipoR1/2 receptors, the adhesion molecule T-cadherin may be involved in the transduction of the adiponectin signal in endothelial and muscle cells. The mechanisms of signal transduction from T-cadherin, as well as from AdipoR2, remain unclear. Studies on the mechanisms of the action of individual molecular forms of adiponectin are extremely rare. The analysis shows the complex nature of adiponectin signaling, many of the mechanisms of  which remain undiscovered, and it is possible that the near future will bring us significant progress in this area."

    "abstract" : "The extraordinary Agrobacterium research story started from the search for the causative agent of crown gall disease more than 100 years ago. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was first isolated from grapevine galls in 1897 and later isolated from Paris daisy in 1907 (Cavara, 1897a,b; Smith and Townsend, 1907). The Agrobacterium infection mechanism involves processing and transfer of a specific DNA fragment (the transferred-DNA, T-DNA) from a bacterial tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid. Transfer to the plant occurs via a type IV secretion system (T4SS), after which T-DNA is integrated into the plant host genome (Gelvin, 2010; Lacroix and Citovsky, 2013). This interkingdom DNA transfer leads to overproduction of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, resulting in tumors. The interkingdom DNA transfer ability of Agrobacterium and the possibility to replace the oncogenes in the T-DNA with genes of interest has made Agrobacterium-mediated transformation the most popular technique to generate transgenic plants. \n \nThis Research Topic provides a collection of reviews and original research articles on Agrobacterium genes involved in bacterial physiology/virulence and plant genes involved in transformation and defense against Agrobacterium. A review by Kado (2014) provides a historical overview of how A. tumefaciens was first established as the cause of crown gall disease. In this review, Kado highlights key early plant pathology and milestone molecular biology studies leading to the conclusion that the expression of oncogenes in native T-DNA is the cause of tumor growth in plants. With the solid foundation of these pioneering discoveries, A. tumefaciens evolved from a phytopathogen to a powerful genetic transformation tool for plant biology and biotechnology research. \n \nThe first complete genome sequence of an Agrobacterium species (A. tumefaciens C58) was completed in 2001 (Goodner et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2001). The 5.67-megabase genome of this strain carries one circular chromosome, one linear chromosome, and two megaplasmids: the Ti plasmid pTiC58 and a second plasmid, pAtC58. In the review by Platt et al. (2014), the properties, ecology, evolution, and complex interactions of these two A. tumefaciens megaplasmids are discussed. The costs and benefits to A. tumefaciens strains carrying the Ti plasmid and/or the pAtC58 plasmid are discussed and presented from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. Modeling predictions are presented for the relative cost and benefits to A. tumefaciens strains harboring the Ti and/or the pAtC58 plasmids determined by environmental resources. Conjugation and amplification of the Ti plasmid are regulated by the TraI/TraR quorum-sensing (QS) system and conjugal opines. Lang and Faure (2014) review current knowledge of the genetic networks and molecular basis of the A. tumefaciens quorum sensing system. These authors also discuss the biological and ecological impact of the QS system on Ti plasmid conjugation, copy number, and interactions between Agrobacterium and host plants. \n \nDuring the initial interaction between Agrobacterium and plant cells, bacteria sense various plant-derived signals in the rhizosphere with the help of Ti plasmid-encoded virulence gene (vir gene) and chromosomal virulence gene (chv gene) products. The current knowledge of how A. tumefaciens senses and reacts to different plant-derived signals are summarized in the review article by Subramoni et al. (2014), which also discusses the mechanisms of how the plant hormones auxin, salicylic acid, and ethylene, affect bacterial virulence. Finally, this review discusses the complexity and intricacy of Agrobacterium signaling pathways and the underlying regulatory mechanisms during the initial host cell recognition to maximize subsequent successful infection. In the original research article by Lin et al. (2014), the mechanistic regulation of the membrane sensor VirA protein is further dissected. VirA histidine kinase and the cytoplasmic response regulator VirG protein together play a central role in regulating vir gene expression in response to phenolics. Based on a homology model of the VirA linker region, various mutant and chimeric VirA proteins were generated and examined for their ability to induce VirB promoter activity. The ability of VirA to sense and respond to three separate input signals, phenolics, sugars, and environmental pH, plays a significant role in securing successful infection. \n \nAgrobacterium attachment to plant cells is an important early step in crown gall disease progression. Motile bacteria swim toward host cells and then physically interact with host cells to form aggregates and establish a multicellular bacterial community known as a biofilm. Various genetic and environmental factors that affect Agrobacterium attachment and biofilm formation are reviewed in the article by Heindl et al. (2014). The functions of different types of exopolysaccharides that constitute the biofilm and underlying mechanisms involving how the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP, the ChvG/ChvI system, phosphorus levels, and oxygen tension influence bacterial attachment and virulence are also summarized. In the review article by Matthysse (2014), early studies and current knowledge of the mechanisms of polar and lateral bacterial attachment are summarized. These two mechanisms both contribute to bacterial attachment. When the environmental calcium and phosphate levels and pH values are low, polar attachment predominates. In addition, the phospholipids (PLs), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphate-free lipid ornithine lipids (OLs) contribute to Agrobacterium virulence. In the review by Aktas et al. (2014), the biosynthetic pathways and the physiological roles of these membrane lipids are summarized. The typical eukaryotic membrane lipid PC is not frequently found in bacteria, but it constitutes almost 22% of the Agrobacterium membrane lipid. Interestingly, PCs and OLs may play opposite roles in Agrobacterium virulence. The reduction of tumor formation in a PC-deficient Agrobacterium mutant may result from impaired vir gene expressions controlled by VirA/VirG. The absence of OLs in A. tumefaciens may decrease host defense responses and therefore cause earlier and larger tumor formation. \n \nPlant cells have a variety of receptors that recognize so-called microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs), and subsequently activate plant defense responses, a process known as Pattern-recognition receptor-Triggered Immunity (PTI) (Boller and Felix, 2009; Boller and He, 2009). Agrobacteriium may utilize effectors to hijack plant systems and evade plant defense responses. Pitzschke (2013) reviews strategies used by Agrobacterium to turn plant defense responses to its own advantage. Infected plant cells initiate a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade that causes VIP1 (Agrobacterium VirE2-interacting protein 1) phosphorylation and translocation into the plant nucleus to induce defense gene expression. On the other hand, Agrobacterium may hijack VIP1 to help T-DNA enter the plant nucleus. Based on the current knowledge of plant defense responses against Agrobacterium infection, Pitzschke (2013) discusses several biotechnological approaches to increase transformation efficiency. In another review by Gohlke and Deeken (2014), early plant responses to Agrobacterium, including various defense responses, hypersensitive responses, and phytohormone level alterations are discussed. The alterations in plant morphology, nutrient translocation, and metabolism caused by crown gall tumor formation are also reviewed. The authors summarize important genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies that reveal epigenetic changes associated with T-DNA integration and gall development. Subsequently, Hwang et al. (2015) review important pathogenic elicitors, host cell receptor molecules, and their downstream signal transduction pathways in host plants during the PAMP-triggered immune response. They highlight recent discoveries linking plant immunity to endomembrane trafficking and actin dynamic changes. Effects of both the host physiology, including hormone levels, circadian clock, developmental stages, and environmental factors, including light exposure lengths and temperature, on plant defense responses and bacterial virulence are reviewed and discussed. \n \nIn nature, evidence of ancient horizontal gene transfers (HGT) from Agrobacterium to plants has been observed in the genera Nicotiana and Linaria. Sequences homologous to mikimopine-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes pRiA4 T-DNA were first discovered in the genome of untransformed tree tobacco, Nicotiana glauca, and named “cellular T-DNA” (cT-DNA; White et al., 1983). Matveeva and Lutova (2014) review cT-DNA organization, distribution, expression regulation, and a possible correlation with genetic tumor formation in Nicotiana species. They also review recent findings of cT-DNA in the genomes of Linaria species and in other dicotyledonous families. The authors suggest that plants maintaining cT-DNA in their genomes may potentially benefit microorganisms in the rhizosphere by secreting opines in the root zone. They also propose that footprints of ancient pRi T-DNA insertions in the plant genome may provide selective advantage to these plants. \n \nWith this Research Topic we provide a platform for scientists to share their understanding of Agrobacterium biology and how Agrobacterium transforms plants. These contributions demonstrate how a highly active research community in plant and microbial sciences can elucidate important pathogenesis questions. Future research on Agrobacteium will continue to advance our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, and provide new insights useful for plant genetic engineering."

    "abstract" : "Respiratory infections, whether novel zoonotic events like the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic or recurrent seasonal epidemics like influenza, remain as intractable global health problems, and elucidation of the underlying innate immunemechanisms that drive antiviral immunity is urgently needed. Uniformly, pathogenic viruses encodemechanisms to subvert antiviral defenses, particularly those conferred by IFN, thus supporting the notion that IFN serves as an important antiviral defense (1–4). More recently, pathogen pattern recognitionmechanisms such as TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7) and TLR9 that recognize viral RNA in endosomes and RNA helicases such as RIG-I (retinoic induced gene) andMDA5 (melanoma differentiationassociated antigen 5) that sense cytoplasmic singleor double-stranded RNA (a unique feature of RNA virus replication and transcription) have been elucidated (5, 6). Unsurprisingly, deeper investigation has revealed virally encodedmechanisms of evading pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-driven antiviral immunity through uncoupling of the signaling cascades stimulated by these PAMPs (7). Much research has focused on the viral-encodedmechanisms, yet little attention has focused on how host mechanisms may be recruited to usurp antiviral defense. In this issue of the Journal, Ouyang and colleagues (pp. 30–40) identify a host factor, NMI (N-Myc and STAT interactor), that is recruited by the influenza virus to reduce IFN type I antiviral signaling (8). Here, the authors show that NMI can enhance proteosomal degradation of IRF7 (IFN regulatory factor 7) via recruitment of the E3 ligase TRIM21 (tripartite motif-containing 21), leading to a decrease in type I IFN expression (Figure 1). The work is novel in that for the first time, a host-regulatory mechanism is used for the nefarious reduction in host clearance of the influenza virus. Much work remains to be done to fully uncover the importance of these findings; however, the study indicates that viral regulation of antiviral defense is not limited to virally encodedmechanisms. Major advances in knowledge have been achieved during the past 20 years regarding viral host defense inmucosal, epithelial, and hematopoietic lineage tissues and cells. First, the elucidation of Toll proteins, particularly the TLR7/9 proteins (9), and subsequently the RNA helicase RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I andMDA5 (10), provide a starting point in antiviral defense. Although these sensors ultimately use distinct signaling cascades, such asMyd88 or TOLLIP by TLRs orMAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) by RLRs, the cascades culminate in activating transactivating transcription factors in the IRF family, including IRF3 and IRF7, thus initiating IFN type I a or b gene expression (11). Subsequent induction and release of IFN a or b proteins from infected cells triggers antiviral defenses through ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes) in surrounding cells and tissues to mount a preemptive antiviral state in neighboring cells and tissues. Furthermore, IFNs represent a molecular bridge to the adaptive immune system, facilitating T and B lymphocyte maturation and playing a critical role in mounting cell-mediated and humoral immunity (12). The role of NMI in normal cell homeostasis is largely unknown, although a role in inflammation involving the release of proinflammatory cytokines has been reported (13). In this issue, Ouyang and colleagues show that leukocytes from natural influenza infection in humans and experimental influenza infection in the lungs of mice produce elevated levels of NMI.Moreover,NMI mice exhibited some protection against flu infection, including decreased lung viral burden and reduced weight loss, as well as increased survival in a lethal challengemodel. These changes were concurrent with increased type I IFN and ISG expression, suggesting that NMI negatively regulates the induction of type I IFN transcriptional programs. Subsequent studies usedmolecular approaches to show direct interaction of NMI with IRF7.Moreover, NMI promotes activation of the E3 ligase TRIM21, which leads to ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of IRF7, a well-recognizedmeans by which virally encodedmediators subvert antiviral defenses. The finding that host proteins may contribute to this subversion of antiviral mechanisms adds yet another wrinkle to the complex biology of the subcellular environment during viral infection. Although the effects ofNMI ablation inmice is somewhat mild, othermechanisms, most notably the viral NS1 (nonstructural 1) protein regulation of antiviral defenses, are still likely functional and likely still active in this experimental model (3). Despite the clear role of NMI as a host regulator of IRF7, some caution is warranted. The studies inNMI mice did not determine the role of NMI in either the lung epithelium or hematopoietic lineage cells in the lung. As such, it remains to be determined whether the biology identified here imparts its effects on antiviral defense in the infected epithelial cell or on the regulation of the innate immune cells involved in adaptive immunity. The heavy reliance on transfected cells for addressing the interactions between NMI, IRF7, and E3 ligase TRIM25 may not be representative of what occurs with physiological protein levels. Importantly, several lines of evidence indicate that murine and human antiviral defenses may be distinct. Influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 can bind to the RIG-1 CARD domain directly and facilitate TRIM25 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of RIG-I (14). However, NS1 binding to TRIM25 is species specific, with human culture-isolated IAV binding to human TRIM25 but not avian TRIM25, and avian-cultured IAV binding to avian TRIM25 but not to human. Neither humannor avian-derived NS1 bind to murine TRIM25 (15). This, however, is advantageous, as it would eliminate the role of NS1-activated TRIM25-mediated proteosomal degradation of RIG-I/CARD inmice, thus reducing antiviral defenses that would obfuscate the role of NMI. It should be noted here that NMI-mediated regulation should also be investigated across multiple lineages of influenza species (e.g., A and B) and"

    "abstract" : "GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS) is a prototypic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system with a global incidence from 0.16 to 4.0/100,000 per year [1]. The following immunological mechanisms are discussed in the pathogenesis of GBS, namely molecular mimicry, epitope spread, bystander activation, superantigen production, and aberrant activation of the complement cascade [2]. Since its discovery in 1989, the IL33/ST2 axis has been explored in different types of immunological disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchial asthma, Behçet's disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, and others. Interleukin33 (IL33) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the interleukin1 family capable of inducing the production of T helper type 2 (Th2) pathway cytokines (IL4, IL5, IL6, and IL13) and enhancing Th1, Th2, and Th17 immunological responses [3]. It is the only ligand for its receptor ST2 (T1 or IL1RL1/interleukin1 receptorlike 1), which belongs to the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) superfamily. ST2 is expressed constitutively in different immune cells such as Th2 lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells. The ST2 receptor has two distinct isoforms, namely a membranebound form (ST2), responsible for nuclear factor (NF)κβ and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MyD88/NFκβ) pathway signaling, and a soluble form (sST2), a decoy receptor responsible for halting the NFκβ signal via IL33 sequestration [4]. IL33 is also known as ‘alarmin’ because of its property of being secreted by epithelial cells to alert the immune cells (which express ST2 receptor) in response to infection and inflammation [5]. The human IL33/ST2 axis plays an important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune disorders. The genetic dysregulation of this IL33/ST2 axis can influence susceptibility to different immunological diseases by means of mechanisms such as impairment of ligandbinding capacity and alteration of geneproduct expression due to the direct regulatory effects of free IL33 on transcription of DNA by virtue of its DNAbinding domain [6]. The present study by Sharma et al. is an elegant study whereby they explored the IL33/ST2 axis in GBS. The findings of this study suggest the influence of the IL33/ST2 axis in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. The authors found that genetic variants of the IL1RL1 gene (CC genotype of rs10192157 and TT genotype of rs10206753) along with gene– gene interaction between IL33 and IL1RL1 genes were significantly associated with GBS [7]. They also observed elevated sST2 plasma concentrations in severe GBS patients, which they proposed as a potential biomarker of severity in GBS. These findings should be validated in larger studies. From the perspective of a neurologist, the clinical relevance of this novel immunological research is that it opens up a new domain in understanding the pathogenesis of GBS with respect to the IL33/ST2 axis. Despite advances in medical science, a biomarker for disease severity in GBS is yet to be discovered. Furthermore, future therapy can be aimed at targeting ST2 receptor signal blocking in GBS to curb the magnitude of inflammation and to expand the armamentarium of immune therapy in GBS."

    "abstract" : "T cell modulation plays a fundamental role to adaptive and innate immunity, which aids the recognition and defense against pathogens while also maintaining self-tolerance. Numerous molecular pathways participate in this process including thymic selection, T cell receptor and antigen-presenting cells cross linkage, along with co-stimulatory signaling cascades. The present review demonstrates a holistic analysis of various classic and novel mechanisms that govern T cell regulation and emerging therapeutic applications. Recent advancements have introduced novel roles in the journey of T cell modulation that can have a pivotal impact on the understanding of this process; for example, phase separation of the linker for activation of T cells, and the newer application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in autoimmune diseases. While discoveries of proximal and distal signal transduction pathways have contributed to the comprehension of T cell anergy, cytokine-mediated differentiation and the delicate balance between immune activation and tolerance, there are still unresolved debates about further molecular mechanisms. There are also still questions about the long-term side effects of CAR-T cell therapy. Deeper research and analysis are required to further aid the understanding and use of this novel therapeutic approach."

    "abstract" : "To defend against microbial invasion, the mammalian host develops a precisely regulated and complex network of cells and molecules that are also capable of discriminating among self, nonself, or missing-self. This is host immune system. The immune system is comprised of two interlinked and dynamic systems known as the innate and adaptive immune systems, and these consist of various cell-types and effector molecules to eliminate diverse threats to the host. The fundamental understanding of cellular and molecular processes adopted by the host is essential for understanding the pathogenesis and development of therapeutic interventions of disease. This issue of International Reviews of Immunology discusses the signaling events that take place during phagocytosis, immune exacerbation leading to respiratory disease, and developments in immunotherapy for blood cancer. Phagocytosis, or “cellular eating,” is mediated by various phagocytic cells of the host and plays a crucial role in various immune and nonimmune processes to maintain physiological homeostasis. The nonimmune process is required for a cleaning of the host by removing dead, old, necrotic, or traumatized cells or cell debris, and also plays an important role in developmental processes of the host. On the other hand, immunological processes are mediated by specialized innate and adaptive phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes, tissue macrophages, and B cells. The key function of these phagocytic cells is eliminating microbial pathogens, inducing inflammation and processing and presentation of microbial antigens to the adaptive immune cells. Phagocytosis is a complex molecular process and the first review article of this issue by Pradhan et al. describes the molecular mechanism of one phagocytic event known as “phagosome maturation,” in terms of phagosome and lysosome fusion, the role of calcium ions to trigger the cascade of signaling, and how microbial pathogens subvert this signaling to establish an infection. The article also provides insight into manipulation of calcium ion signaling to combat various infectious disease (Figure 1). Asthma is an obstructive lung disease characterized by the thickening of airway walls and an overproduction of mucous leading to difficulty in breathing. The asthmatic condition could be triggered by environmental factors, microbial infection, or it is associated with the host genetics. Immunologically, it develops due to an excessive presence of eosinophils and a strong T helper type 2 response through the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The second review article in this issue, by Evangelos et al., discusses the correlation between lung infection and asthma in the light of innate immune sensors, particularly toll-like receptors (Figure 1). Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is a malignant disease of lymphocytes originating from lymphatic tissue."

    "abstract" : "T helper (TH) cell polarization during priming is modulated by a number of signals, but whether polarization to a given phenotype also influences recall responses of memory TH cells is relatively unknown. Here we show that miR-181a is selectively induced in both human and mouse naive T cells differentiating into the TH17, but not TH1 or TH2 subset. In human memory TH17 cells, miR-181a regulates responses to cognate antigens through modulation of ERK phosphorylation. By enhancing the signalling cascade from the T-cell receptor, such molecular network reduces the threshold of TH17 cell activation. Moreover, at a late time point, the same network induces a self-regulatory mechanism dependent on ID3, a negative regulator of transcription factors that control RORC expression, thus modulating TH17 activity. Our results demonstrate that the phenotype acquired by TH cells during priming contributes to their threshold of activation to secondary antigenic stimulations, thus influencing memory responses. How the magnitude of the response is regulated in different T-cell memory subsets remains poorly understood. Here the authors show that miR-181 lowers the threshold of Th17 memory activation via sustained Erk phosphorylation, while Erk-dependent induction of ID3 limits Th17 activity at later time."

    "abstract" : "The angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is involved in the regulation of blood pressure (through vasoconstriction) and water and ion homeostasis (mediated by interaction with the endogenous agonist). AT1R can also be activated by auto-antibodies (AT1R-Abs), which are associated with manifold diseases, such as obliterative vasculopathy, preeclampsia and systemic sclerosis. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to AT1R-Abs binding and associated signaling cascade (dys-)regulation remains fragmentary. The goal of this study was, therefore, to investigate details of the effects of AT1R-Abs on G-protein signaling and subsequent cell proliferation, as well as the putative contribution of the three extracellular receptor loops (ELs) to Abs-AT1R signaling. AT1R-Abs induced nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling, which reflects Gq/11 and Gi activation. The impact on cell proliferation was tested in different cell systems, as well as activation-triggered receptor internalization. Blockwise alanine substitutions were designed to potentially investigate the role of ELs in AT1R-Abs-mediated effects. First, we demonstrate that Ang II-mediated internalization of AT1R is impeded by binding of AT1R-Abs. Secondly, exclusive AT1R-Abs-induced Gq/11 activation is most significant for NFAT stimulation and mediates cell proliferation. Interestingly, our studies also reveal that ligand-independent, baseline AT1R activation of Gi signaling has, in turn, a negative effect on cell proliferation. Indeed, inhibition of Gi basal activity potentiates proliferation triggered by AT1R-Abs. Finally, although AT1R containing EL1 and EL3 blockwise alanine mutations were not expressed on the human embryonic kidney293T (HEK293T) cell surface, we at least confirmed that parts of EL2 are involved in interactions between AT1R and Abs. This current study thus provides extended insights into the molecular action of AT1R-Abs and associated mechanisms of interrelated pathogenesis."

    "abstract" : "Ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a dynamic process that involves two distinctive yet interrelated phases of ischemic organ damage and inflammation‐mediated reperfusion injury. Although multiple cellular and molecular pathways contribute and regulate tissue/organ damage, integration of different players into a unified mechanism is warranted. The crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune systems plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of liver IRI. In this review, we focus on recent progress in the mechanism of liver innate immune activation by IR. Kupffer cells (KC), DCs, NK, as well as T cells initiate local inflammation response, the hallmark of IRI, by utilizing distinctive immune receptors to recognize and/or trigger various molecules, both endogenous and exogenous. The interlocked molecular signaling pathways in the context of multiple liver cell types, the IRI kinetics and positive versus negative regulatory loops in the innate immune activation process are discussed. Better appreciation of molecular interactions that mediate these intricate cascades, should allow for the development of novel therapeutic approached against IRI in liver transplant recipients."

    "abstract" : "Residual chlorine is a common by-product of warm drainage in coastal nuclear power plants. when accumulating to some limit, it may threaten marine ecosystem especially for benthic clam. However, there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms related to immunity and antioxidant of residual chlorine stress on clams. In this study, the clam (Cyclina sinensis) was exposed for 96 h at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 mg/L) of residual chlorine to observe its mortality, measure the activity of antioxidant and immune-related enzymes, and analyses the gene expression level in the hepatopancreas by using the transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the mortality rate increased with the increase of stress time and concentration, and the mortality rate in the 400, 450 and 500 mg/L groups reached 100% at 96 h. The tolerance to residual chlorine of C. sinensis decreased with the increase of chlorine dioxide concentration, and the LC50 of 96 h was 217.6 mg/L by linear regression method. After residual chlorine stress, the activity of antioxidant-related enzymes (T-AOC and SOD) in the hepatopancreas showed a trend of first increase and then decrease with the extension of stress time. The immune-related enzyme activities of AKP and LZM showed a downward trend between 0 and 96 h, while the ACP enzyme activity showed a trend of first rising and then decreasing. Transcriptome analysis showed that residual chlorine stress significantly changed the expression levels of immune-related molecules associated with signal transduction, prophenoloxidase cascade, cell apoptosis and pattern recognition protein/receptor. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase (GST), heat shock protein (HSP) and other antioxidant-related genes were significantly affected under residual chlorine stress. This study provided valuable information for understanding the effects of residual chlorine stress on survival, physiological metabolism and molecular mechanisms of immune and antioxidant functions of C. sinensis."

    "abstract" : "Dysregulation of adipose tissue functions makes a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, one of the most common diseases in recent years. Adipose tissue is an organ that secretes at least several dozen signaling molecules, adipokines. One of the most studied and at the same time mysterious adipokines is adiponectin. The latter is due to the lack of clear ideas about the biological role of this adipokine, the presence of its several molecular forms with different activity and several types of receptors to this adipokine localized in almost all cells of the body. The purpose of this review is to summarize and analyze the available information about the molecular mechanisms of the effect of adiponectin on metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and lipoproteins. The literature search was conducted by the keywords \"adiponectin\" and \"metabolic syndrome\" in the Pubmed and Elibrary.ru databases for the period from 1995 to 2021.According to the results of the literature analysis, it is assumed that adiponectin is involved in energy metabolism as a «satiety» hormone that promotes the utilization and storage of energy-rich substrates, fatty acids and glucose, which prevents the development or mitigates the already developed insulin resistance. This reduces the amount of plasma triglycerides and increases the level of high-density lipoproteins in the plasma. Adiponectin affects metabolic processes by activating the AdipoR1-APPL1-LKB1-AMPK, AdipoR1-APPL1-p38, AdipoR2-PPARa cascades, and possibly by activating the ceramidase and phosphoinositide pathways and insulin signaling. In addition to the AdipoR1/2 receptors, the adhesion molecule T-cadherin may be involved in the transduction of the adiponectin signal in endothelial and muscle cells. The mechanisms of signal transduction from T-cadherin, as well as from AdipoR2, remain unclear. Studies on the mechanisms of the action of individual molecular forms of adiponectin are extremely rare. The analysis shows the complex nature of adiponectin signaling, many of the mechanisms of  which remain undiscovered, and it is possible that the near future will bring us significant progress in this area."

    "abstract" : "The extraordinary Agrobacterium research story started from the search for the causative agent of crown gall disease more than 100 years ago. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was first isolated from grapevine galls in 1897 and later isolated from Paris daisy in 1907 (Cavara, 1897a,b; Smith and Townsend, 1907). The Agrobacterium infection mechanism involves processing and transfer of a specific DNA fragment (the transferred-DNA, T-DNA) from a bacterial tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid. Transfer to the plant occurs via a type IV secretion system (T4SS), after which T-DNA is integrated into the plant host genome (Gelvin, 2010; Lacroix and Citovsky, 2013). This interkingdom DNA transfer leads to overproduction of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, resulting in tumors. The interkingdom DNA transfer ability of Agrobacterium and the possibility to replace the oncogenes in the T-DNA with genes of interest has made Agrobacterium-mediated transformation the most popular technique to generate transgenic plants. \n \nThis Research Topic provides a collection of reviews and original research articles on Agrobacterium genes involved in bacterial physiology/virulence and plant genes involved in transformation and defense against Agrobacterium. A review by Kado (2014) provides a historical overview of how A. tumefaciens was first established as the cause of crown gall disease. In this review, Kado highlights key early plant pathology and milestone molecular biology studies leading to the conclusion that the expression of oncogenes in native T-DNA is the cause of tumor growth in plants. With the solid foundation of these pioneering discoveries, A. tumefaciens evolved from a phytopathogen to a powerful genetic transformation tool for plant biology and biotechnology research. \n \nThe first complete genome sequence of an Agrobacterium species (A. tumefaciens C58) was completed in 2001 (Goodner et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2001). The 5.67-megabase genome of this strain carries one circular chromosome, one linear chromosome, and two megaplasmids: the Ti plasmid pTiC58 and a second plasmid, pAtC58. In the review by Platt et al. (2014), the properties, ecology, evolution, and complex interactions of these two A. tumefaciens megaplasmids are discussed. The costs and benefits to A. tumefaciens strains carrying the Ti plasmid and/or the pAtC58 plasmid are discussed and presented from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. Modeling predictions are presented for the relative cost and benefits to A. tumefaciens strains harboring the Ti and/or the pAtC58 plasmids determined by environmental resources. Conjugation and amplification of the Ti plasmid are regulated by the TraI/TraR quorum-sensing (QS) system and conjugal opines. Lang and Faure (2014) review current knowledge of the genetic networks and molecular basis of the A. tumefaciens quorum sensing system. These authors also discuss the biological and ecological impact of the QS system on Ti plasmid conjugation, copy number, and interactions between Agrobacterium and host plants. \n \nDuring the initial interaction between Agrobacterium and plant cells, bacteria sense various plant-derived signals in the rhizosphere with the help of Ti plasmid-encoded virulence gene (vir gene) and chromosomal virulence gene (chv gene) products. The current knowledge of how A. tumefaciens senses and reacts to different plant-derived signals are summarized in the review article by Subramoni et al. (2014), which also discusses the mechanisms of how the plant hormones auxin, salicylic acid, and ethylene, affect bacterial virulence. Finally, this review discusses the complexity and intricacy of Agrobacterium signaling pathways and the underlying regulatory mechanisms during the initial host cell recognition to maximize subsequent successful infection. In the original research article by Lin et al. (2014), the mechanistic regulation of the membrane sensor VirA protein is further dissected. VirA histidine kinase and the cytoplasmic response regulator VirG protein together play a central role in regulating vir gene expression in response to phenolics. Based on a homology model of the VirA linker region, various mutant and chimeric VirA proteins were generated and examined for their ability to induce VirB promoter activity. The ability of VirA to sense and respond to three separate input signals, phenolics, sugars, and environmental pH, plays a significant role in securing successful infection. \n \nAgrobacterium attachment to plant cells is an important early step in crown gall disease progression. Motile bacteria swim toward host cells and then physically interact with host cells to form aggregates and establish a multicellular bacterial community known as a biofilm. Various genetic and environmental factors that affect Agrobacterium attachment and biofilm formation are reviewed in the article by Heindl et al. (2014). The functions of different types of exopolysaccharides that constitute the biofilm and underlying mechanisms involving how the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP, the ChvG/ChvI system, phosphorus levels, and oxygen tension influence bacterial attachment and virulence are also summarized. In the review article by Matthysse (2014), early studies and current knowledge of the mechanisms of polar and lateral bacterial attachment are summarized. These two mechanisms both contribute to bacterial attachment. When the environmental calcium and phosphate levels and pH values are low, polar attachment predominates. In addition, the phospholipids (PLs), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphate-free lipid ornithine lipids (OLs) contribute to Agrobacterium virulence. In the review by Aktas et al. (2014), the biosynthetic pathways and the physiological roles of these membrane lipids are summarized. The typical eukaryotic membrane lipid PC is not frequently found in bacteria, but it constitutes almost 22% of the Agrobacterium membrane lipid. Interestingly, PCs and OLs may play opposite roles in Agrobacterium virulence. The reduction of tumor formation in a PC-deficient Agrobacterium mutant may result from impaired vir gene expressions controlled by VirA/VirG. The absence of OLs in A. tumefaciens may decrease host defense responses and therefore cause earlier and larger tumor formation. \n \nPlant cells have a variety of receptors that recognize so-called microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs), and subsequently activate plant defense responses, a process known as Pattern-recognition receptor-Triggered Immunity (PTI) (Boller and Felix, 2009; Boller and He, 2009). Agrobacteriium may utilize effectors to hijack plant systems and evade plant defense responses. Pitzschke (2013) reviews strategies used by Agrobacterium to turn plant defense responses to its own advantage. Infected plant cells initiate a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade that causes VIP1 (Agrobacterium VirE2-interacting protein 1) phosphorylation and translocation into the plant nucleus to induce defense gene expression. On the other hand, Agrobacterium may hijack VIP1 to help T-DNA enter the plant nucleus. Based on the current knowledge of plant defense responses against Agrobacterium infection, Pitzschke (2013) discusses several biotechnological approaches to increase transformation efficiency. In another review by Gohlke and Deeken (2014), early plant responses to Agrobacterium, including various defense responses, hypersensitive responses, and phytohormone level alterations are discussed. The alterations in plant morphology, nutrient translocation, and metabolism caused by crown gall tumor formation are also reviewed. The authors summarize important genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies that reveal epigenetic changes associated with T-DNA integration and gall development. Subsequently, Hwang et al. (2015) review important pathogenic elicitors, host cell receptor molecules, and their downstream signal transduction pathways in host plants during the PAMP-triggered immune response. They highlight recent discoveries linking plant immunity to endomembrane trafficking and actin dynamic changes. Effects of both the host physiology, including hormone levels, circadian clock, developmental stages, and environmental factors, including light exposure lengths and temperature, on plant defense responses and bacterial virulence are reviewed and discussed. \n \nIn nature, evidence of ancient horizontal gene transfers (HGT) from Agrobacterium to plants has been observed in the genera Nicotiana and Linaria. Sequences homologous to mikimopine-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes pRiA4 T-DNA were first discovered in the genome of untransformed tree tobacco, Nicotiana glauca, and named “cellular T-DNA” (cT-DNA; White et al., 1983). Matveeva and Lutova (2014) review cT-DNA organization, distribution, expression regulation, and a possible correlation with genetic tumor formation in Nicotiana species. They also review recent findings of cT-DNA in the genomes of Linaria species and in other dicotyledonous families. The authors suggest that plants maintaining cT-DNA in their genomes may potentially benefit microorganisms in the rhizosphere by secreting opines in the root zone. They also propose that footprints of ancient pRi T-DNA insertions in the plant genome may provide selective advantage to these plants. \n \nWith this Research Topic we provide a platform for scientists to share their understanding of Agrobacterium biology and how Agrobacterium transforms plants. These contributions demonstrate how a highly active research community in plant and microbial sciences can elucidate important pathogenesis questions. Future research on Agrobacteium will continue to advance our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, and provide new insights useful for plant genetic engineering."

    "abstract" : "Respiratory infections, whether novel zoonotic events like the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic or recurrent seasonal epidemics like influenza, remain as intractable global health problems, and elucidation of the underlying innate immunemechanisms that drive antiviral immunity is urgently needed. Uniformly, pathogenic viruses encodemechanisms to subvert antiviral defenses, particularly those conferred by IFN, thus supporting the notion that IFN serves as an important antiviral defense (1–4). More recently, pathogen pattern recognitionmechanisms such as TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7) and TLR9 that recognize viral RNA in endosomes and RNA helicases such as RIG-I (retinoic induced gene) andMDA5 (melanoma differentiationassociated antigen 5) that sense cytoplasmic singleor double-stranded RNA (a unique feature of RNA virus replication and transcription) have been elucidated (5, 6). Unsurprisingly, deeper investigation has revealed virally encodedmechanisms of evading pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-driven antiviral immunity through uncoupling of the signaling cascades stimulated by these PAMPs (7). Much research has focused on the viral-encodedmechanisms, yet little attention has focused on how host mechanisms may be recruited to usurp antiviral defense. In this issue of the Journal, Ouyang and colleagues (pp. 30–40) identify a host factor, NMI (N-Myc and STAT interactor), that is recruited by the influenza virus to reduce IFN type I antiviral signaling (8). Here, the authors show that NMI can enhance proteosomal degradation of IRF7 (IFN regulatory factor 7) via recruitment of the E3 ligase TRIM21 (tripartite motif-containing 21), leading to a decrease in type I IFN expression (Figure 1). The work is novel in that for the first time, a host-regulatory mechanism is used for the nefarious reduction in host clearance of the influenza virus. Much work remains to be done to fully uncover the importance of these findings; however, the study indicates that viral regulation of antiviral defense is not limited to virally encodedmechanisms. Major advances in knowledge have been achieved during the past 20 years regarding viral host defense inmucosal, epithelial, and hematopoietic lineage tissues and cells. First, the elucidation of Toll proteins, particularly the TLR7/9 proteins (9), and subsequently the RNA helicase RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I andMDA5 (10), provide a starting point in antiviral defense. Although these sensors ultimately use distinct signaling cascades, such asMyd88 or TOLLIP by TLRs orMAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) by RLRs, the cascades culminate in activating transactivating transcription factors in the IRF family, including IRF3 and IRF7, thus initiating IFN type I a or b gene expression (11). Subsequent induction and release of IFN a or b proteins from infected cells triggers antiviral defenses through ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes) in surrounding cells and tissues to mount a preemptive antiviral state in neighboring cells and tissues. Furthermore, IFNs represent a molecular bridge to the adaptive immune system, facilitating T and B lymphocyte maturation and playing a critical role in mounting cell-mediated and humoral immunity (12). The role of NMI in normal cell homeostasis is largely unknown, although a role in inflammation involving the release of proinflammatory cytokines has been reported (13). In this issue, Ouyang and colleagues show that leukocytes from natural influenza infection in humans and experimental influenza infection in the lungs of mice produce elevated levels of NMI.Moreover,NMI mice exhibited some protection against flu infection, including decreased lung viral burden and reduced weight loss, as well as increased survival in a lethal challengemodel. These changes were concurrent with increased type I IFN and ISG expression, suggesting that NMI negatively regulates the induction of type I IFN transcriptional programs. Subsequent studies usedmolecular approaches to show direct interaction of NMI with IRF7.Moreover, NMI promotes activation of the E3 ligase TRIM21, which leads to ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of IRF7, a well-recognizedmeans by which virally encodedmediators subvert antiviral defenses. The finding that host proteins may contribute to this subversion of antiviral mechanisms adds yet another wrinkle to the complex biology of the subcellular environment during viral infection. Although the effects ofNMI ablation inmice is somewhat mild, othermechanisms, most notably the viral NS1 (nonstructural 1) protein regulation of antiviral defenses, are still likely functional and likely still active in this experimental model (3). Despite the clear role of NMI as a host regulator of IRF7, some caution is warranted. The studies inNMI mice did not determine the role of NMI in either the lung epithelium or hematopoietic lineage cells in the lung. As such, it remains to be determined whether the biology identified here imparts its effects on antiviral defense in the infected epithelial cell or on the regulation of the innate immune cells involved in adaptive immunity. The heavy reliance on transfected cells for addressing the interactions between NMI, IRF7, and E3 ligase TRIM25 may not be representative of what occurs with physiological protein levels. Importantly, several lines of evidence indicate that murine and human antiviral defenses may be distinct. Influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 can bind to the RIG-1 CARD domain directly and facilitate TRIM25 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of RIG-I (14). However, NS1 binding to TRIM25 is species specific, with human culture-isolated IAV binding to human TRIM25 but not avian TRIM25, and avian-cultured IAV binding to avian TRIM25 but not to human. Neither humannor avian-derived NS1 bind to murine TRIM25 (15). This, however, is advantageous, as it would eliminate the role of NS1-activated TRIM25-mediated proteosomal degradation of RIG-I/CARD inmice, thus reducing antiviral defenses that would obfuscate the role of NMI. It should be noted here that NMI-mediated regulation should also be investigated across multiple lineages of influenza species (e.g., A and B) and"
